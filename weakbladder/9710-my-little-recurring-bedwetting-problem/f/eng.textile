I've just recently left my teens, and its getting a little ridiculous to still be a bedwetting, that is to say one who doesn't do it on purpose. But as ridiculous as it is it just doesn't seem to go away. I never wet the bed as a child, well not more than a couple of times. I was actually in college when i started. It was rather difficult to hide and caused me a good deal of stress. I went on doing it about every other night for 4 months through college, never letting my roommates find out. I did however get found out by two special friends i had sleep over on separate occasions. Both of them girls. As much as i like wetting and omorashi i still found it incredibly embarrassing accidentally peeing on them.

But it did go away after the 4 months. However it seems to pop back up again from time to time. I just started working a job that causes me to have a stressful sleep pattern and when i got home from work to take my nap I woke up soaked in pee.

I have been to a doctor and i've been told in the past that there is nothing medically wrong with me (Horay). It seems to me that its psychological.
