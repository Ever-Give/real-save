Last night some friends and I had a few drinks, went to a party on the other side of the city, and came back to my apartment to crash. One of our friends, Heather we can call her had a particularly huge amount to drink. Anyways we all passed out and when I woke up in the morning my friend Gina told me that she had found Heather on the floor of my bathroom, passed out, naked, with all of her clothes in a "Suspicious bunch" in the ground. Gina woke her up, they got themselves together, heather apparently put on the clothes that were on the floor and they left. Later, when I went to put the futon back together, I noticed it was all wet, there was standing liquid on the right side about half way down the futon. I took a picture with my phone and texted Gina saying "What is this?" And together we put together that Heather had peed the bed. The liquid which had a faint oder of pee, the wet clothes in the ball, the drunk Heather. It all added up.

To be nice we have decided not to tell Heather, because we believe she doesn't remember to spare her the embarrassment. But if she asks well... then maybe we can have some fun. Maybe I should have Heather sleep over more often. ;)
