Yesterday ... as I was working on the bathroom

This happened yesterday morning.

While I am light remodeling the upstairs bathroom (replace the faucet, scour all the surfaces, fill, wash , and clean the bub), I have discovered that I get a huge urge to pee when I am in the most awkward of situations.

Yesterday, I was trying to uncouple the water supply hoses to the faucet - which means I was under the sink (inside the cabinet) when the urge to pee hit. I knew I could hold it for a while yet and went back to concentrating on releasing the stuck threads.

The more I pushed and pulled against the stuck hose, the more my lower back slid off the towels I had propped under me. The edge of the cabinet pressed into me. I finally got the threads to turn, a little bit, but had to twist myself to get an angle to loosen it more. I pushed the wrench. I could hear my stomach slosh. The cabinet pressed into my side.

Breathe. Ok, now I was feeling more pressure. The more I turned the wrench, the more I moved the more I felt it. Then I could hear water running. I had turned off the water and disconnected the hoses, so I knew it wasn't the sink. As I turned, and twisted, my bladder began to ache a little bit. I stopped and listened again. There it was - water running - but kind of far off. That sound was making me squirm. I pressed my legs together to see if that helped the pressure. It didn't. If could get this one side off (turn 1/8 of a turn), reposition the wrench, then I could slide out and have a pee. OH, don't think that word.

Turn another 1/8 turn.

Could it be the toilet?

Turn another 1/8 turn.

No, the toilet is unhooked and off.

Turn another 1/8 turn.

Ooooh. I felt my bladder pushing. (Don't think about it, turn the wrench!)

Turn another 1/8 turn.

Slip. Damn! Replace the wrench. Turn 1/8. Reposition the wrench. Turn 1/8 turn.

If I got out now, I'd just have to get back into position (Turn 1/8 turn).

Focus on something else. (Turn 1/8)

I need to use my itunes gift card. (Turn 1/8)

What do I need to add? (Turn 1/8)

Do Vixy & Tony have a new CD yet? (Turn 1/8)

Do I have all of Crystal Bright & The Silver Hands yet? (Turn 1/8)

WHERE was that water sound coming from? (Turn 1/8)

(Turn 1/8)

Ooh, my sides are beginning to hurt. (Turn 1/8)

I can feel my bladder pressing. (Turn 1/8)

(Turn 1/8). (Turn 1/8)

I can hold it. Just squeeze like you are trying not to come. (Turn 1/8)

OH OH that hurts! (Turn)

(Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

I can't let go here ... someone downstairs might wake up and see me half under the sink - peeing myself. (Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

OK, I can hold it. I think I might have dribbled a little.

(Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

I'll say it was from the sink.

(Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

I can still hear the water. (Turn faster)

The dishwasher? (Turn faster)

No, It must be up here. (Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

(Turn faster)

The wrench slides down with the faucet hose. Droplets of water hit me in the face.

(OH NO...! Ok a few drops or more leak.... I can hold it...)

Wait... it's only water left in the supply line. (Whew!) Now I can get out...

Then I feel it. A trickle of water on my toes. Tickling. Wet. Warm.

I feel it. The warm, naughty feeling of relief when I let go. The rush of air to my lungs; oxygen to my brain; the dizziness of the warm jets. My pee is noisy in my pants, through my underwear and I flood my thighs, stomach. I feel the heat of my hot stream covering me. It is running over my hips and between my cheeks. It is tickling my balls and wetting my hair - plastering it to my inner thighs and legs and stomach. My flood seeks to cover as much of me as it can reach. It is the same feeling after I pull a splinter out of my finger. The pressure is suddenly gone. Released. No ... RELEASED. Like a diver's frantic breath. A gulp that fills the entire body and makes it buzz and tingle.

...

I am breathing again. (I think.) The deluge slows a little. I am dizzy. I am hard. I may have even orgasmed. I don't know. I am wet.

I am so wet. I think I am done when I breathe and I feel another warm gush. It flows easily now, over the path of the other streams. I remember to breathe again.

This is what the land must feel like as a river floods its banks - soaking everything....

...

I don't know how long I am out (if at all). I am soaked and smell of pee. Like mineral spring when you expect a stream. I want to see if it is like that, but all at once ...

I feel ...

Cold.

Naughty.

Excited. (Did I really just pee myself - and the floor?)

Naughty.

Horny.

Embarrassed.

Relief.

I want to lie here forever... if the pee was still warm, I might have even fallen asleep...

Thanks to everyone for being so supportive that I felt I could share this with you.
