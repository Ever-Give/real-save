So I was travelling for work, and had been drinking water all day to stay hydrated, but had left some herbal medicine at home, so decided to go do a little bit of shopping at the nearest pharmacy.

Unfortunately this is remote central Queensland, and the nearest pharmacy was an hour drive away.

Got to the pharmacy, got what I needed, and started heading home. I knew I needed to pee soon, but figured I'd make it home ok.

Was about half way home when I started getting desperate. I mean, REALLY desperate. Decided to hold it as long as possible.

Being a guy, I could've just pulled over and peed on the side of the road, but where's the fun in that.

Continued to hold, but when I was about 10mins from home, I couldn't holding any longer. Little bit leaked out, so pulled over. By this time, it was dark. Took my shorts off and stood behind the car and just let it all gush out on the dirt through my undies. Felt so good.

When I finished, I put my shorts back on, jumped back in the car, and drove home with wet undies. Felt so liberating!
