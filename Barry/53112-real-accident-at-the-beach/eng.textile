I’m literally sitting on the beach atm, and have had a real wetting accident.

2.40 pm. I’ve been out, and had a few beers. Came home bursting, and peed about half into the toilet. I had to.

The beach is a six minute walk from home, so I packed some beers, and drank one on the way. When I got here, I was absolutely busting again.

I sat on the sand cross legged, and it started leaking out. I couldn’t stop it. I deliberately let a bit more out, then sat back. I had another beer, and it quickly built up again. I just let my bladder go completely, and now my shorts are soaked, and I’ll definitely have to go in the water.

Wet shorts feel great though.
