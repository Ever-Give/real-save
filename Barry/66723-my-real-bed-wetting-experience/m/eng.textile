My real bed wetting experience

So I stuffed up on Sunday. Had to go to a function with free drinks, so I obviously didn’t want to drive. I was at the venue earlier, but took the car home before coming back.

My back and neck were sore, so being silly and knowing I wasn’t driving, I smoked a little weed, and took a Tramadol before getting dropped off.

The day went well, and beer flowed freely, although I didn’t drink a huge amount, perhaps 6-7 stubbies.

But suddenly, the weed and opiate kicked in like a mule, and I was completely wasted. Like supremely drunk all of a sudden. I’d gotten there at 3, and it was only 6. We hadn’t even eaten yet. But it was no good. I had to go home.

My lift arrived and picked me up, but I remember none of it. My wife said she knew straight away that I’d taken a pill as soon as she saw me. I went to bed before 7.

Woke up at 10.30, wearing extremely soaked briefs, although the bed underneath me was only damp. I switched the light on, and found the foot of the bed was drenched.

I had taken my pants off, sat down, and somehow wet myself, before crawling up and going to sleep.

It’s not a nice conversation to tell your wife that you’ve wet the bed......

She slept in the spare room.
