I drank a few glasses of water last night before I went to bed so I'd be really desperate when I woke up this morning. It worked like a charm. I got up and had to go really bad. But I didn't let myself go just yet.

First I looked for a nice pair of jeans, then I went into the kitchen to have another glass of water. After that I looked around the house looking for a good spot, hurried along by the pressure in my bladder. I decided on the bathroom since it the cleanup would be easy.

I stepped into the tub, leaned back against the wall and finaly let go. It felt wonderful, feeling the warmth and wetness spread around my crotch and down my legs. It was a lot too.

Eventually it stopped and I looked down at the damage. Satisfied, I washed away what remained in the tub with a quick burst from the shower head, the stepped out.

Sorry if the pics aren't very good, it was hard to get a good shot and it's my first time taking pics or posting about it.
