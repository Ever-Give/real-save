Hello :) I am the only one who can't stay in the bathtub without peeing myself? It started like a naughty game, but now It's almost imposible to resist it! (And I love it...)

The first time it was when I was 16, I had a hard day in class and I wanted to relax in the bathtub. It happened in winter, I filled the bathtub with warm water, and when I entered my entire body I realized that I had to pee so bad... but I was so relaxed that I holded it a little more.

Five minutes later, I really really needed to pee, but I didnt wanted to get out of the bathtub because it would be so cold outside... So I thought to myself ''Nobody can see me, how bad can it be to relax...?''. First I was very very ashamed, but then I relaxed my bladder, and I felt the water getting warmer between my legs, and then the warmth was spreading though all my body.

I can't describe how relaxed I was, the water turned a little yellowish and I felt my urine caressing all my body underwater... I couldn't hold myself and I ended up masturbating in the bathtub... but the details are private and I know no one of you want to hear them hahaha :$

Now, 2 years later, every time I introduce my body inside a bathtub with warm water, almost automatically all my pee flows slowly from my bladder... I love that feeling... Please, if anyone can, try to do it, It's very relaxing and exciting... Thanks for your attention :) I hope you liked it, I never told it to anyone... Have a pleasant day :)
