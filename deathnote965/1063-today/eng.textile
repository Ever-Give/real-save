Hello everyone, this is my first post, and it will hopefully not be my 

Last, i have many more stories, but have not got the motivation to be anything but a lurker till now lol

Today was a rather uneventful day....it was around 6 and i had already run out of this to do (tis a shame that Wet Note is only updated every

Thursday, kudos to Zryouiki for an awesome parody) then, my phone rings, i was rather confused as i had not been expecting any calls....

It turns out it was a really good friend of mine, she wasn't going to be able to talk to me for awhile, so she wanted to talk and say goodbye, etc.

This is where it took a turn for the...."worse" a few minutes into our talk, she told me she had to pee (she knows everything about me,

ESPECIALLY how to press my buttons, or in english, my omo fetish) then her sister barged in and they got into a HUGE fight, and she had to let me go....i thought nothing of it and went back to finding something to do.

I called her back about 2 hours later when everything should of settled down a bit, and she was singing some song about Narwhals O_o anyways, she had to stop in the middle of it because she STILL had to pee and did not go after the arguement with her sister, convenient, right?....she moaned a bit and told me "i have to pee, ohhh i have to peeeee" she usually takes me with her so i can listen, but i knew she wasn't going to this time.....she just wanted to have her fun with me

I asked her, begged her to let me listen and the whole time she was struggling to get out her refusals, eventually it got to the point where she just had to go, right that moment, or she would pee herself, but she didn't, she just kept moaning and gasping louder, repeating "i have to pee" over, and over again, each time sounding more desperate until she finally said "ohhhh!! i have to pee so bad!!, no, no i'm not taking you with me, i have to peeee!!" the last thing i heard was her whimpering as she took off for the bathroom.....how i would of loved to hear her after finding out she had to go soooo badly....

Sorry, but unfortunately for you guys, and girls, she made it, although i'm sure some of you get turned on by very close calls lol, i'll try to have more details when i question her about it when she gets back ^^
