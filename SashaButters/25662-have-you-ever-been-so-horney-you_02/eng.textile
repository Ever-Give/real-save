Hey don't let one bad experience discourage you. Though that is a good thing that you're shy and not like some girls who fucks anything that looks like a dick. It can be a big deal to actually get to the point where you wanna have sex. That's no problem at all. I'm sure there will be a guy one day who make you feel 100% comfortable with every point of what's going on :) It's better to wait for that person than to be fooled by others.

:) thanks. I've already come to terms with the fact that i'm going to be a crazy cat lady. Maybe i'll meet someone someday, but in the meantime, I have a date with my kitchen table... jk :D

But I need him to deny it more, I love it when he's mean to me. Probably because he's so sweet normally, seeing that transition is....

So what you were posting gave me an idea in my Just Let it Out series. I tried to write a tame version of it lol It came out ok i think. idk if you don't mind yuri, i'm not to good with details. Maybe yo can give me a few pointers.

He said what!? that's horrible! He's probably fugly himself and has self esteem issues! wow... :/ listen, don't let any guy or girl convince you you're not attractive... Everyone's attractive in their own way.

And don't worry about the whole penis thing, it took me til I was 18 to even know what one looked like! xD

He kept going on about how his family had standards for him and blah blah. lol i'm 24, have never gotten past kissing. But it's more cause I'm into girls. I just have a religious family where being gay is like OMG *shun* I'm just stuck right now trying to force myself to try and find a guy because according to them "You just haven't met the right one"

So once the medicine wore off my sex drive kicked in for girls, i was like....well....didn't see that one coming lol

LOOOOOL!

I just read an article in the Dutch news quoting a woman who said that once she had quit taking the pill, she felt like she "could f*ck 10 Marines".

So yes, it is a well known issue.

I've only ever had one wet dream I don't even remember what it was, I just woke up and I was wet! Must have been something omo-related though, although I'm unlike to ever have it again since the last thing I do before I sleep is to rub one out
