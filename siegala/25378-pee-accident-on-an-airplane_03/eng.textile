I've wet myself on a plane before. It really is more common than people think.

It really seems to be more common than one should believe - especially under "certain circumstances".... Would you mind telling us how the "scenario" was in your case...?

(Hope you could get trhough iht without too much embarrassment...)

I was rushing around. I had some tea and water and needed to pee before I got off my first plane. I had a connecting flight and Inna e were running late so I didn't get s chance to use the bathroom. Any way on my destination plane we hit turbulence and I was just on my way to the toilet when they ordered us back to our seat. I jtarted leaking. Anyway, the floodgates opened and I could not hold it I just started peeing into my pants and couldn't stop. When the plane landed, I stayed on and the let me change into dry clothes that I had in my carry-on. I always keep some extras in the carry-on incase they lose my luggage.

Ow, that actually sounds like a rather embarrassing experience... I am afraid, passengers around you might also have realised what was going on....?

Did you try to talk to the cabin crew to make an exception for you and let you go, as it was an emergency? Usually that won´t work, but in rare cases it does - so it is always worth a try, you actually don´t have to lose anything... But obviously in your case the flight attendants were strictly following the rules...? :-((

My flight was a few days ago now, but I didn't get desperate at all, and to be honest I admire those who could get desperate on a plane. Whereas others would plan to be desperate and drink a lot, my plan on flights is the opposite-- drink nothing, don't go for a wee whatsoever. I cannot cope with tiny plane toilets. The flight back is going to be the same... I am being good! And a bit boring! Lol.

However, this was a wonderful story. :) Thank you for sharing it.

Come on, Chloe! Take just a very tiny risk on your flight back! ;)

I could see how it could happen to me. I put off going to the bathroom in public till I really, really, have to. Even when I'm obviously going to have to go at some point. On a short flight I just plan ahead and don't drink much, but on something intercontinental I'm obviously going to have to use the bathroom at some point. So a few times on flights I've got really very desperate before I forced myself to go pee. If I got particularly unlucky and was stuck in my seat due to turbulence in those moments I could definitely end up with wet pants.

But in general you try to avoid the risk, right...?

I was rather lucky though up to now, also never risking anything - however had sometimes rather close calls on planes, could have ended up wet ocassionally...

{{:

Absolutely I try to avoid the risk. I don't fly very much either, particularly I don't catch flights long enough that I can't just not drink much that day and easily wait. So I would have to get pretty unlucky. It's a bit of a nightmare situation really. You are trapped there for the rest of the flight. People are almost certain to find out... Much embarrassment.

You are so right... Though I have to admit that I found the wetting accident of the young woman on the plane "interesting" (otherwise I wouldn´t have posted it...) I feel very bad for her ... And in fact I find it really stange that her colleagues who witnessed all that didn´t seem to have been supportive at all for her... Must have been some very weird guys, to be honest...

{{:

I think it depends. Some of my colleagues that I'm friends with I would really try to be supportive toward, but for others that I don't really know well I'd probably just try to not make a fuss about it. And that's what I'd want if it was me that had an accident.

That´s an interesting aspect indeed, as it totally correlates with what the woman who wrote about her accident on the plane described her feelings and her emotional "dilemma". In fact, she wasn´t too much disappointed that none of her colleagues really seemed to "care" too much about her accident.

On the other hand her most important concern (actually the reason why she started to blog about her experience) was how to deal with her colleagues, as they all witnessed it and she feared it will always remain an "unspoken issue" between her and them in the future business relationship... THAT´s what she actually asked for advice in her post...! (Despite the question how to "avoid" getting caught in such a situation in future...).

Expectedly, people in the blog couldn´t really help her very much concerning both questions...
