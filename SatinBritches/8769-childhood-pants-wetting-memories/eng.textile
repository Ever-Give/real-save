One memory I have from my childhood is of wetting my pants one day after school.I was around 10 years old and really had to go bad by the time school let out.I was about to burst on the bus ride home and on the walk home from the bus stop started to do a few short bursts in my pants.I was running home I had to go so bad.I got home only to find mom was not home and the door was locked.She had gone shopping when I was in school and would be home in a few minutes.The worst possible day for her not to be home.I wasnt going to ask the neighbors if I could use their bathroom.

I can remember starting to lose all control about then and making a run for the garage so none of the other kids on the street would see me in wet pants or want to stop and talk as I was about to pee my pants.I was scared mom would be mad at me If I wet.I just made it to the garage then lost all control and couldnt fight it anymore.I just stood there and full force peed my pants.There I was standing there in my wet pants waiting for mom to get home and after half an hour she did get home and She wasnt even mad at me and even said sorry for being late getting home.Just one of several childhood memories.I will post more under this topic in the next few days.

About age 9 or 10 I remember peeing in my snow pants.Mom took me and my sister along with a few of our friends to the local park to go sledding.We were sledding for a few hours,But I had drank a few cups of hot chocolate during the trip and had to go rather badly but kept avoiding the long walk to the rest rooms.I kind of put the need to go out of my mind then it was two late.I remember myself starting to lose control and after a few short bursts just full force peeing in my snow pants.It didn't show because of the waterproof snow pants.I still remember the way it felt as it ran down my pants into my boots.All the way home I was scared Mom was going to give it to me good for going in my pants.I remember getting home and mom making my sister and me take off our snow things in the kitchen first thing.First thing I took off was my boots that were soaked.

Standing there in my wet socks then it was time to take off the snow pants and I was really scared.Scared my sister was going to laugh at me and scared that mom was going to punish me.I can remember that the jeans I was wearing under my snow pants were just soaked.I remember my sister not laughing because as soon as she got out of her snow pants running to the bathroom She was starting to lose control and after just starting to have an accident making it just in time to avoid a full force wetting.Mom did yell at me good and I was grounded for a week.My sister never did laugh at me.I think she realized Just how close she to came to a full force pants wetting.
