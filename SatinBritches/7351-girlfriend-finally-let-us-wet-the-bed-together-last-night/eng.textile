My girlfriend gave me a pleasant surprise yesterday.When I was at work she had put a rubber sheet on the bed and set out two pairs of satin panties on the bed.My GF isnt really into wetting very often and rarely into wetting the bed so that is something that I hardly ever get to do.When ever she is in the mood for it she will only do it wearing underwear and pajamas.She and I do share our underwear drawer and neither one of us really like wetting in cotton underwear as they tend to become cold and uncomfortable soon after wetting them.The satin panties feel heavenly to pee in besides Brenda loves seeing me in panties.

We both held most of the day with only her having an accident several hours earlier in the day,but her panties were dry by bed time.By bed time we were both starting to lose control some and getting desperate.As soon as we got into our pajamas into bed and comfortable she started to hint that I should go first.I was starting to do a few little squirts bet wasnt about to go first if I could help it.Then she gets really quiet and you could hear the pee starting to hit the rubber sheet.

She could hear it to because she stopped her self after about 10 seconds.I laughed then just started letting it go.At first laying on my back and it felt great as it started running around my hips and between my legs starting to get my butt wet.Brenda started laughing as the rubber sheet sound started this time from me.Then I just rolled over on my tummy and finished full force with out stopping. Felt great as it was soaking my t-shirt and the front of my legs and front of my pajamas.

No sooner had I finished than that rubber sheet sound started again Brenda totally let go and full force peed the bed to.I honestly thought she was going to chicken out and get up to use the bathroom.I asked her about this and she said I was already wet from you wetting that she figured whats the use. Likely story was my response as it was her that planed out this night.About 5AM in the morning just before we got up I peed the bed again and she laughed and to my surprise wet it to.

I offered to do the laundry but she said I have another idea,just pull back the blanket and the sheet will mostly dry.After showering she hung her :wub: wet pajamas and panties over the back of the chair and told me to do the same,Then she smiled.Could it be that this shy girlfriend of mine is starting to enjoy wetting ? She will never admit to it but her actions say otherwise ! :D

Next time you both decide to wet the bed, try laying on top of each other and let go. The sensation of being peed on is something else.

I would love to try this but Brenda is really shy about wetting.She is starting to enjoy it more now,but I will give her a few more times wetting so she gets more comfortable with it before I try this with her.

No wetting the bed the past few months but now that were both home for the day were having a holding contest.Brenda is starting to lose now as I can notice a two or three inch wet spot on her pants and she cant sit still. I'm needing to go badly myself but still have full control.This is one contest thats going to end in a tie.As soon as she loses it I plan on letting go and wetting mine as well.That should be any second now.She just turned red and a puddles forming under her chair and she just gave me the finger.I better end,Time to wet my pants so wont win this contest.

OK now I wish I could get a rubber mat because I love the sound of pee and barely ever get to hear it...
