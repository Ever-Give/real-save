Go out late, desperate, dressed for jogging: shorts, tshirt. Take a backpack with a pair of sweatpants and a bottle of water. Jog if you want, but wait 'til you're bursting and then sit down on a bench. When no one is nearby, let it go. You can then pour water over yourself to dilute it if you like. The shorts won't hold a lot of wetness, and will be hidden from sight when you pluu on your sweatpants for the walk back to the flats.

I won't pour the water on me to dilute it, but this definitely sounds a great idea to try out :D I've got the perfect idea for what to wear as well, I've got some lil soft red short-shorts that I could wear and go out in to do the wee, so I've got to go and find a bench I could use :) Thank you for the idea hun, it's added to the list :D x

{{:

Could you list some other games or maybe movies or something you own? If I know what the choices are, I can try and come up with systems for them.

}}

Games-wise I've got *deep breath* Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 (and 2 I haven't started yet), Final Fantasy X, Yu-Gi-Oh Duelists of the Roses on PS2; and Mario Sunshine, Resident Evil, Wind Waker, Mario Kart, and Soulcalibur 2 on Gamecube :p

Movies depressingly I only own Jackass 3 as I've had to sell the rest >.<

{{:

I am always in for a holding contest. If it is going to happen I like to join if I can.

}}

Absolutely :) the more the merrier!

What I'll be doing is actually getting a diary of events for the week written down which I'll post on here, and as more ideas come in I'll update the diary :)

Also, please give me ideas for clothing choices, scenarios, and more roleplay ideas! I've loved the ideas you've all given so far and can't wait to hear of more :) xxx

*tries to remember how to play Yu-Gi-Oh >.<*

Oh yeah, this is the one with a 7x7 grid and Deck Masters :p http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_The_Duelists_of_the_Roses

I don't think I could manage pints that frequently so it'd have to be a lower measurement - maybe I could buy a small shot cup or 10 and have those ready beer-pong style and chug those whenever one of those happens :)

*adds to list* thank you hun, keep the ideas coming! :D x

Here's one I got. Try to stay awake as long as you can one night, to get a long sleep for the next day. For every hour you slept, add a drink onto your day, to be drunk with any of the other challenges.

One I suggested for Gemmy's (though since you said your computer's slow it might not work), watch a Micheal Bay movie on youtube, and for every explosion or such special effect, take a drink.

Also, can we assume you will relay some of these stories to us after you're done with them?

}}

I like the sleeping one - I might try that on the first day so that I can do a couple of night wettings in public :)

Youtube works okay with my laptop so I could do that as well :)

I'll not only post stories, I'll be in the IRC as well for the entire week :D If you or any others want to write stories to help me out then you're more than welcome to :) xxx

Hmm... SC 2 eh?

I haven't played it in forever but I seem to recall some sort of tower where you could fight infinite enemies in an exhibition type fight, though I could be wrong. It could be fun to see how far you get before you go. And if you're good at the game, see if you die or pee first.

}}

Admittedly it's been a while since I've played it too... but this sounds an amazing idea :D *adds to list* thank you hunny :3 xxx

One neat little bit to tag on to another challenge.

Go for the standard "drink at regular intervals and wait" type of challenge, but on top of that, every time you check the clock, it adds an additional pint. Encourages trying to time yourself.

}}

Oo, sounds good :) again, pints are too much for me but I can definitely do small cups as I'll fill up just as much and hold longer so you can all enjoy my desperation :D x

Has anyone else got any more ideas? It's only next week! :p x

Thank you all for the ideas - I've come across a snag in that I won't be available now until Monday afternoon, and I'll be out on Tuesday for a bit, and unavailable on Thursday as well - basically I've got family to look after and my hot water has gone as well and I've got a plumber coming to sort it out sometime next week >.< I'll let you know closer to the time but give me more ideas please! :D x
