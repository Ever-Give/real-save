And despite this thread now being 5 months old it still get new posts! :D Thank you all so much for the kind comments, I always appreciate them and the ideas :D

Next week I have a week off, and I hope that on Monday sometime a new thread will appear named "Birthday of Bea" with some new content... and I am making a list of ideas you're all posting, but I won't say what I will be doing until it happens ;) xxx

A change? :P I guess you mean "chance" but yes there might be a Summer of Bea 2 ;) I'm currently moving flat so I won't be able to do anything until then, and even still I need a new laptop as the cam on my old one is busted so it's touch-and-go at the moment >.< x

And guess who has a week off at the end of August again? ;)

Also, I've started an album with my current and full knicker collection here: https://omorashi.org/gallery/slideshow/album-79/

Any requests for what to wear and what outfits? I've got a few months to prepare ;) x

Hee hee, I stole that idea from Wettingherpanties' Charlotte (she wore the same pair with black writing on the back for one of her webcams a few months back) :P x
