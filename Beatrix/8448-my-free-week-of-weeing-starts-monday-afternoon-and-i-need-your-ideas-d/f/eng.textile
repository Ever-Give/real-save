Heya everyone, just a quick message to let you all know that if anyone's interested I've got the week off from Monday afternoon and will be on here most of the week doing holds and accidents and whatever you'd like me to do :) If any of you are interested reply here or find me in the IRC from Monday about 6pm British time (1pm USA east coast time), and let me have some ideas. I know I already made a thread about my ideas but I just wanted to add a reminder of my week of to you all :)

If you're all lucky you may get some pics and/or videos as well (if my cam works and lets me - it tends to crash my computer when I try and get pics and vids!)

Hope to see you all during the week :D

Much love,

Bea x

Ooo, I'm loving these ideas! Thank you so much everyone :D

Here's one I thought of, how about when you're doing your laundry(for obvious reasons ;) ) you sit on top of the washing machine and/or dryer with a full bladder and try to hold on until the cycle is done.

}}

Sadly my washing machine is under a tabletop but I could try this - it won't be until the end of the week as I won't have any washing to do until then... for obvious reasons ;)

{{: 

When I read this forum, I thought you were going to attempt to hold and not use a toilet for an entire week. :p

}}

I can barely last an hour or two on a good day, let alone a week! :p

{{ 

Umm, i think it would be cute if you drank loads of juice like apple, summer fruits etc. and you manage to fall asleep with a full bladder, when you wake up your surrounded by a nice smell and an empty bladder

}}

I've tried to wet the bed with water and alcohol... never tried apple juice though - I'll give this a try later in the week (when I've got money to buy some!) and let you know how it goes.

{{ 

You should drink a lot of water and get really desperate, and at the last second, pee in the toilet, but with your panties still on.

}}

I sometimes don't get the choice of taking them off ;) I'll definitely do this for you :)

{{ 

What about you wear pants with some laces that you can make a knot on them so you really wont be able to get the pants down when you need to.... then you could pee through them on the toilet

}}

Oo, gonna have to try and find some when I've got money on Wednesday, but I've got somewhere in mind where I can buy them... might have to get some tight, white pajama bottoms with a tie waistband :)

Keep the ideas coming everyone, and suggest outfits for me to wear as well and what you want me to do whilst wearing them :D xxx

I think you should do a public wetting if youre brave enough (God knows im not). Itd be awesome if you would be talking to one of the cashiers when your getting the supplies this week and act (or be:P) super desperate and have an accident right there or in the parking lot.

Oh and maybe get a really full bladder and watch a really scary movie and try to scare yourself into peeing.

}}

I won't do it in a shop but I'm planning on heading to some woods near where I live and doing a desperate walk with a very full bladder and letting nature take its course ;)

I shall try the scary movie one - has anyone got any ideas for which movie? I'll be out Wednesday morning shopping for new clothes (post suggestions for those please!) so I'll grab a movie as well if I find one I like the sound of ;) x
