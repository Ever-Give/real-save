Some might disagree there . It does sound as though you were right at your limit, so you still win my approval! That's what's usually been my downfall - I usually drink quite a bit of water and tea during the day, and don't even try to plan ahead for a long journey (I'd rather have to stop somewhere than feel thirsty). It's never resulted in damp seats - and that aspect of omo really doesn't interest me anyway - but it's been pretty difficult at times!

My dad wouldn't have! I really was! Why thank you! I do drink a lot usually but I avoided it that day because I knew about the car journey! I've wet a little on a seat before but never fully!

Did you know beforehand that it was busy and that you might be delayed? I've had some nightmare journeys like that, and invariably ended up stuck in really bad traffic just at the point of getting unbearably desperate! I don't think I've ever done a five hour journey in one go though, although I could probably just about stretch that far as long as it wasn't first thing in the morning!

No I didn't but my dad said it might be a bit busy, I didn't realise he meant 5 hours busy though!

Great story! I always enjoy your stories. You really know how to hold your pee in to have held it that long and no one noticed. Have you ever had to pee so bad that someone noticed or you had a visible accident? When you said you crossed your legs awkwardly how exactly was it awkward, like was the top leg pulled up and back to squeeze harder? Didn't your brother notice you holding yourself when you were running into the bathroom? How bad did you wet your leggings and panties when you couldn't quite get them down in time? Did you have to change? Did you think you might wet yourself bad in the car or hotel before you got to the bathroom or were you confident you could hold it?

Thank you so much! I can't say I ever have really, maybe that day will come soon! Yes that's what I mean but also because there isn't a lot of leg room! If he did he didn't say anything! The panties were quite wet indeed but the leggings were only slightly damp in places. I didn't change, until the evening meal later on. I was pretty confident I could hold it actually! But I did have a couple of 'oh shit' moment that's I thought if we didn't get to the hotel soon I would.

I hope that you never have a public accident but I've heard the statistics say most adults will have at least one. Those 'oh shit' moments can be scary but I am glad you could hold it. I think most women can hold it in longer than guys and sometimes have to! I only wish I was there to watch you hold it and watch you use the toilet!

I probably will do. I have had an outside accident before though but there was no one around, it was at New Years eve actually! I think it's probably easier for women to hold it. Hehehe ;)

Was it this past New Years eve? I would like to hear the story sometime.
