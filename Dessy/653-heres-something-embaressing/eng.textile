I was in the hospital for a few nights, and on the second night I woke up in the middle of the night (very very rare..) and i had to pee so bad, i think i was just out of it ether from meds or because i was still kinda asleep, but i couldnt find any kind of call button.. and it does not help at all that your not allowed to wear any type of underwear >.> i still dont really fully remember that night so i cant really give a whole lot of details, but I ended up wetting the bed, it sucked.. i dont think there is anything more embaressing then telling some one you barely know that u wet the bed =/

When someone came in, I basically asked what happens if someone wet their bed... i think she replied with a "did you?" or something like that and i just kind of nodded... ha, that was by far the most embaresing bath i ever had lol. and as I said before, there actually was a button lol, i just couldnt think good enough to find it

I cant really remember.. I think it had something to do with my heart beating to slow or something.. might of been to fast.. meds killed my memory of that night and like the week before it lol.

{{:

I'm rather curious about the "bath" you got. How did they give you a bath at a hospital? Was it just a sponge bath or something, and did they even let you bathe yourself?

That sounds like something that would utterly humiliate me.. but I'd love to be a doctor in such situations x~x

Sponge >//> and im pretty sure i was pretty incapable of doing it myself... lol

{{:

Whoa...a new heart. Well, I'm not good a this stuff and dunno what to say but I wish you good luck.

}}

Dont worry about it, its nothing that will put me in much danger right now
