Ok... so this is one of the earlyest i remember clearly... i think i was maybe 6 wen this happened..(all times are guesses because i cant remember them at all...)

Me and my mom were at walmart, our walmart used to have this little food court in it, and i dont remember why but i remember i drank alot of pop. so we left the food court and me and mom went shoppingit was maybe 10 or 15 minutes after that that i started needing to go, i told mom and she just said "ok" and continued shopping, then maybe another 10 minutes told her again and she said "ok hun were almost done" i remember by then i was dancing a little.

So i waited like another 5 minutes and told her again and she said she was just going to try on clothes and then she would take me... turns out it takes her like 20 minutes to try on clothes >.> so i think maybe like 10 or 15 minutes later i was sitting on a bench dancing and i leaked.. i went into the changing room and knocked on moms door (i knocked on the wrong door the first time XD)and i told her i had to go really bad and she said to hold on.. i dont remember what happened next i do remember i had an accident like literally right in front of the bathroom door, i just stopped.. i think it was from shock of it... my mom just look back and asked what i was doing and then she saw the puddle on the floor... then she grounded me T.T

Sorry it dont have a whole lot of detail.. its hard to remember from so long ago o.o

What she said she was mad about was that i only needed to hold it for like 30 seconds and that i just stood there.. and i dont even know why i stood there... lol and that moment i swear i couldnt do anything, i remember i never even let it go.. the entire time is was holding it it just came out.. lol if that makes any sense DX
