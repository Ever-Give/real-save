When you can't hold it anymore how dose it come out for you? does it just shoot out all at once or does it come out in little spurts? I heard when people lose controll of there bladders the pee comes out differently depending on the persons bladder. So how dose your pee come out when you cant hold it?

For me, I get to a point where my bladder starts to hurt. When that happens my bladder begians to contract for some reason. With each contraction a little bit of pee always comes out, I cant help it. After a certian amount of time my bladder gives up and contracts to the hardest and my pee just shoots out until I'm empty. It dosnt help that I have a small bladder too.
