I was about 7 years old just hanging out with my grandmother she decided to take me to this weird shop because she wanted to hang out with some of her friends.My grandma said yes to whatever i asked for so before we had even got there i had a lot to drink.So when we got arrived i already had to go but i didn't think we would stay long.So met the friends acting a little shy and the shop looked weird to me so i asked if could look around they said sure just please becareful.It wasnt a huge shop but still plenty to see.When i walked away i would say a couple minutes later the urge hit me hard instead of looking around the shop i started dancing around looking for a bathroom there were a good amount of doors to check but most of them were locked and the other one were closets.

I was getting nervous and had given up i started to think that there wasnt a bathroom there in the first place. I was moving around very quickly desperatly trying to hold it as long as i could but i knew i couldnt wait much longer.So i sat in a corner by myself crossing my legs tightly still trying to hold it until the pee started to drip out and soon i was standing in a puddle.My shorts were completly soaked and i didnt know what to do i wanted to cry but i didnt.My grandma had been looking for me since i hadn't come back to the room she was in and of course she saw what happened.She just came up to me gave me a hug and said why didn't you say you had to pee there was a bathroom in the room i was in (wasnt that luck >.<).I felt horrible but happy that i no longer had to go.
