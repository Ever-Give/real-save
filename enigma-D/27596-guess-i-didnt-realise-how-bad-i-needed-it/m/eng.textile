Guess I didn't realise how bad I needed it

Hey everyone.

Just wanted to share a couple of photos with you all.

Not much of a story to tell, just I had a long day and finally got some time to play some video games for a while to relax. A few hours passed and I stood up and finally realised I needed to pee.. badly.

As I stood up the desperation came on fast and strong. It was so bad I decided it would be ok to just let a little out, enough to get me downstairs to the loo... guess I needed it worse than I realised cus once I did that I couldn't stop. I tried and tried but the pee came out in forceful squirts as I tried and then it just exploded out of me completely soaking myself.

It felt so good to go though. I've never been that desperate so suddenly before. I was soaked everywhere, my socks drenched and even a puddle on my carpet (that was the worst part).

Anyway I took a couple of photos of the aftermath in my boxers, hope you enjoy :) (also sorry one is upside down lol)
