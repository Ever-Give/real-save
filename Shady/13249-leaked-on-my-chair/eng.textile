So, this happened to me earlier today, and I decided that I'd go ahead and post about it. It's not a real long story, but there's some pictures of what happened at the end.

I'll start off by saying that last night, I did not go to the bathroom before going to bed. I managed to hold my bladder in my sleep, which seems kinda strange considering my history with bedwetting, but that's definitely in the past now. I've actually been doing this quite a bit lately. Anyways, as I was waking up, my bladder started to hurt, but I decided to keep holding and see if I could find my breaking point, so to speak. So, I went over to my computer and opened up the best site around (this one, of course :p). 

I looked at some new posts and went into the forum games to make a few posts. I also looked through my Facebook newsfeed and some other sites. I waited around looking through the forums for a while before deciding to get dressed for the day, but during that time, I leaked a bit on this old and beat up chair that I use. I meant to get a picture of my bulge before I went to the bathroom but didn't get that, but I did get a couple pictures of how my chair looked before I cleaned off the wet spots, even though the lighting was kinda bad.

After I got to the bathroom, the pee was maybe about 30-40 seconds if not longer.
