Thanks again everyone for the appreciation! I'm just trying to live up to my life mantra to only present things I want others to present to me, in this case present a story I myself would want to read. Of course I could just mention in passing "I saw a girl wet herself on the bus home, it was awesome, lol!" but that does not a worthy story make. It takes inspiration even to retell a true sightning, not least when it comes to string together all the mental images in the right order. It's as much about sharing the actual experience as depicting the scene. That might be part of the reason why I haven't really bothered posting before, but recently there has been some really ace stuff featured here (I'm mainly thinking of that norweegian guy and the australian guy, can't remember their nicknames though, hope you'll forgive me for that) so I kinda felt I had something to contribute as well.
