Ok so one day in school i had practice exams.i was drinking alot of water on purpose just to get desperate.i Also skipped my morning pee. So halfway through the test,i really felt the need to pee.but instead of asking to go to the bathroom, i ask if i can fill up my water bottle for the 3rd time.seeing the water arch out into bottle was gruesome, But i tried to make it look like i didn't have to go.so back to the class room i go and i drink A forth of my bottle down, and get back with my test.

30 min later i can't stop fidgeting or squeezing my legs together.

5 min after that pee dribbles out of me,i successfully make it stop, only a small amount on my leg.its now time for lunch,i eat a apple and down another bottle of water.it was starting to hurt to hold, so when my class got to the room. i asked to go to the bathroom as i was walking, little by little pee was escaping my bladder i busted into the bathroom and went into the stall. And the unspeakable happens,i start to wet my pants.it was for like a min and

A half i was crying from embarrassment.the bathroom moniter For the test hears me and thankfully it was a senior pal one of my favorites.she said its ok I'll go get your cousin.my cousin calls my mom and she was ok with it.she took me home and it was never spoke of again.
