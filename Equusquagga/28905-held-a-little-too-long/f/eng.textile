Hey all!

So I've been unwell for a good two weeks now and I'm starting to get bored of resting, less so on the keeping hydrated part but there you are. Anyway it's just about 6pm here, I've needed To go since earlier in the afternoon.

I'd literally been to the loo about 15 minutes before I was hit with the urge to go again, and I was writhing about in bed haha, but i was also feeling pretty unwell and soon stopped moving as I needed more rest. I was lying in bed telling homeanddry about my need and he was asking what I was doing to hold back the flood but I was too weak to do anything! I just lay there for a fair bit.

Thing is after a while I perked up and was bored, I was messing about filming my housemate with the video camera and moving about a fair bit as I had to pee. I went on video call to my bf for a bit and messed about filming stuff some more but it got to the point where each step I felt my bladder moving in for the finale so I changed the direction of my desperate pacing and went into the bathroom.

Now I was bursting but I wanted it to be more involuntary than voluntary and as I was standing with one hand between my leg my body decided for me with a few drips and then a forceful spurt. I hurried to the toilet and had a really relieving pee.

I took a couple pics one of me fighting to hold on and another blurry shot of my slight wet patch haha!
