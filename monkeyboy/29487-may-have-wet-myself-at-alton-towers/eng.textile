Hi all when I was 15 I went on a school trip to alton towers I drank quite a lot seeing as how they has free refills on coke anyways after a few hours of trecking around with some mates going on a few rides like spinball whizzer I I really don't like heights or speed so there was no way I was going on Rita. Or oblivion

Eventually we spotted a few other people and the teacher waiting in line for the log flume As we walked over she told me and a few others to correct our school uniform which at the time was black polo shirt and jumper and trousers anyways about 45 mins

Into our wait I really needed to pee I announced this quite loudly because the wait was only another hour and I have massive amounts of bladder control plus I really didn't are wat people thoughtof me back then (I'm serious I've woke up with my morning pee with the intention of holding throughout the day to have an intentional accidental wetting and gone through til going to bed and still not had an accident) eventually our wait was over and we got on the ride by this point I did need to go quite badly I guess the coke caught up with me

On the ride I screamed all the way as like I said I don't like speed or heights I was literally grabbing my mates shoulder all the way whilst he was laughing at me especially at the end where you go rapidly down into the water

We all got of the ride and our teacher lead us to the toilets and I waited outside with her whilst everyone else went in the funny thing is my teacher must have realised this as she turned to me and said didn't you need to go quite badly before the ride I shyly smiled at her and said I don't need to anymore she simply laughed I looked down and noticed i was quite a bit wetter than everyone else with my trousers and base of my jumper/ polo shirt glistening in the right light (I didn't actually realise what I had done until my teacher pointed it out)
