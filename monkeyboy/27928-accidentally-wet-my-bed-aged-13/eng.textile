I wanted to recount one of the rare occasions I accidentally wet the bed I was wearing blue pajama bottoms and black boxers I don't really know how it occurred but I just remember half waking up I didn't notice the pressure in my bladder and it was quite early in the morning so I just closed my eyes and relaxed I then noticed this strange feeling of relief coming from my dice so I pulled back my pajamas and boxers and too my horror I was peeing full force onto my bed I lay there peeing for about 30 seconds before it stopped my bed and I were completely soaked I waited a couple of minutes before I got the courage to tell my mum who simply told me it was okay and started sorting the mess out

Ye she always was even when it was because I'd stumbled in drunk and when she found out that I'd started doing it on purpose it's probably because my sister frequently wet because of her kidney problems
