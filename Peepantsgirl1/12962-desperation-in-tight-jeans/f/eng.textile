Hi guys!

First of all i need to say sorry this took so long for me to write this i had a power cut and it messed up my computer (that is to the people i told i was going to write this post).

Anyway, i've already drank five litres of lemonade and lots of water and my bladder is filling rapidly.

My need is rather big as i am looking directly at the loo.

Thirty minutes on and i'm squirming in my seat.

I was letting out small leaks so i can last longer but as i let out another leak i wee quite a bit and my knickers start to go damp (lacy knickers).

One hour on and i was on the verge literally if i made a single move i would explode.

Five minutes on and i could not hold it just came out my jeans go dark but i stop the flow but as i regain posture i just explode my jeans just explode with wee and i was lying in my bed of my own wee.

Hope you liked this

:)

I would recommend investing in a new keyboard. It is a bit difficult to read posts when there aren't any commas! And if you don't want to get a new keyboard, at least format the posts so they're easier to read without the proper grammar.

Please, please, PLEASE - never drink 5 liters again! You could kill yourself that way.

I once had 3 liters within one hour and started filling really dizzy and light then, I got quite scared and just tried to get it all out, and started eating things also (I think that's the best way to fight it).

I think a reasonable limit should be 2 liters in one go, and 4 liters for 6 hours. For 24 hours, the limit should be 6-8 liters or so, I think.

Maybe IFMP can give some thoughts on this as well.
