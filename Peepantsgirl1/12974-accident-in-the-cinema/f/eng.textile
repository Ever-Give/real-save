I was in the cinema whatching the hobbit with my boyfriend when the need for me to pee was begining to build up. There was only 40 mins left so i thought my bladder would hold but it had its own plans. I was drinking a coke while whatching which was really not helping. 20mins left of the film and im really desperate and i dont want to miss much so i just held on. I was on the verge of exploding when film ended i quickly went to the tiolet in the entrance. On each side of the entrance there are toilets and i went to one side and noticed it was out of order and i let out a small leak. I walked to the other toilet but as i did i let out a giant spurt and a small patch appered. Into the tiolet and went into a cubical. I tried to pull down my skirt but i just lost control and i completely soaked myself peeing everywhere.

Hope you enjoyed
