Hello, everyone! I just wanted to let you guys know that I have been holding pee since this morning, and have recently just drank two (I'm assuming liter) bottles of water, and am about to go for a third even though I am getting pretty desperate. I also am going to have to take a shower later, so I may end up exploding in the shower. I'm wearing jeans and a tee-shirt, but I'm about to switch to sweats for comfort, and so that my bladder isn't being unnecessarily compressed, as I would like to hold on for as long as possible before uncontrollably wetting myself. If you guys have any holding challenges, or anything else to say, I would love to talk to you guys as I hold! However, like I said, I'm getting very desperate very quick, so hurry up! Thanks, guys :) !
