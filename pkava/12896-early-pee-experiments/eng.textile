When I became a teenager I became curious about peeing and pipi. I didn't have much opportunity to be alone, the bath was one of the few private places.

At first I tried simple things like wetting myself in the shower.

Then one time I came home from school bursting to wee but my mother was in the bath with the door locked. I knocked on the door and she said she would be out in a few minutes, but I could not wait that long. I ran to the kitchen and found an empty glass jar, like for preserving fruit. I ran to my bedroom, my little sister was not there, and closed the door. I quickly let down my trousers and pressed the jar to my pee place, and just in time.

It came out so fast I was worried about spilling. Once started I moved the jar away a little to allow air out as my pee filled the jar.I was surprised at how warm it felt through the glass. And it felt so good to empty my bladder, and not in the toilet.

When my mother came out of the bathroom, I was afraid she would catch me, but I was able to sneak the jar in to dispose of the evidence.

This started me on the idea that there were many other ways to pee.

Did you play private pee games when you were growing up?
