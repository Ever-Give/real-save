Great story, your really good at making a story arousing but not too vulgar, its kind of naughtily cute :)

Also the splitting up of your story into 5 sections is clever, readers won't be put off by a single HUGE block of text, rather they will see 5 small blocks of text and enjoy each one separately. Not sure if you intended that or if its meant to be some kind of desperation scale, or if it has not purpose at all, whatever the case I loved this story and this comment is way to long so bye ^^

It's for ease of readability. When writing stories, I constantly go over it to see which parts I can shorten without clipping out the details ^^ I can't read for a very long time, as my attention goes elsewhere and sometimes I lose the sequence of what is happening. At times, I'll read over the same line twice, so I sympathize and try to simplify my writing as much as I can.

I don't see an "edit" button. How do I do that?

Because you waited too long. It's okay, I guess. People who skip to this page will be able to read the story now :)

I used to, but I had to give up all the stuff I had by the time I moved back with my parents.

Did you throw it away or give it to a friend?

No, silly. I couldn't ever trust anyone with these things, no matter how close. I just got rid of them.
