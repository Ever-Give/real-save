I got to experience the joy of seeing three desperate women the other afternoon while waiting at the Casino Connection. For those who may not live in a very casino heavy town like mine, I'll explain. All the casinos in my area offer free shuttles that pick people up at designated stops called Casino Connections and take them to/from the local casino of their choice. So it's basically a bus stop, but there is an air conditioned building that you wait in with two bathrooms that cost .50 to use and a few vending machines. I work at the outlet center connected to a local casino, so sometimes when I'm not too close to home or don't have my car with me I'll use the free shuttle to get to/from work. This particular night, I had stayed over at a friends and was riding the shuttle to work. But the only way I could get to the Connection to wait for my shuttle was by getting there over an hour early and waiting.

I had (not purposefully, but I'm sure as hell glad I did) chosen to sit in the seat closest to the women's restroom. About fifteen minutes after my wait began, a shuttle dropped off a group of people. One woman in particular hobbled off the bus seeming very alarmed and frantic. She was probably in her late twenties - early thirties. She had very shiny dark brown hair that reached to mid back and wore small black heels, a mid length yellow skirt, and a black top. She wasted no time hurrying inside and rushing straight to bathroom. She tried to pull on the door handle twice before realizing that it costed the .50 to unlock the door (I'm not sure she could fluently read/speak English). She was stepping from foot to foot very quickly but with small steps, but her face alone gave her desperate state away.

She bent over as she began to search through her purse for the change, still rapidly moving her legs. She found it very quickly, and I was sure my fun little show was over now. She pressed her hands against her thighs (I'm assuming to keep herself from grabbing her crotch) and bounced up and down a few times before regaining her composure enough to put the coins in the slot. They went in with ease and she went to open the door - but it was stuck. She became visibly frustrated and frantic, crossing her legs as she jiggled and tugged and pulled on the handle before trying with much force to push the door open by slamming her shoulder against it. But nothing worked. 

She was obviously worried and began to bounce up and down again, much faster now as she scanned her surroundings. I'm not sure why she didn't try to use the male bathroom at this point. But her fight didn't last much longer as a very tall, muscular man came over and pounded on the door himself a few times and managed to force it open. She ran in without even thanking him, and that was the end of her story.

But when she left, she slammed the door tightly after her again and I got to witness two more desperate females attempt to get it open. Neither of which succeeded. The second after she left was much closer to my age, probably between 18-21. She wore acid wash jeans, a pink tee shirt, and a pink beanie. She was also hispanic and with very long, thick black hair and beautiful dark eyes. I didn't see her get off the bus. I noticed her once she entered the connection and very quickly walked to the bathroom with her .50 already in hand. Her desperation tactic as she entered the change was to clench her thighs together and give the occasional wiggle. She went through the same motions as the first - jiggling and pulling the handle in every possible way, pushing and pulling, slamming herself against the door.

She must have attempted to open the door for at least ten minutes, growing increasingly desperate with time. She would let out frustrated groans and the cutest desperate whimpers as she danced in place between struggling to open the door. But she ended up running out of the building at a very impressive speed, her hands instantly shoving between her legs as soon as she was outside. I didn't see her at all before my bus came, so I'm not sure where she ended up.

The last was definitely the most boring of the endeavors. This woman was white, in a wife beater and shorts and had very matted red hair. Like the others, she left the bus and instantly beelined for the bathroom, dancing on the spot. She was cursing under her breath as she searched her pockets for change, wiggling in every direction. The door never opened for her either, but she only tried for a minute or two before just fishing out more change and walking into the mens restroom - which opened with ease.

I don't know why no one else has replied yet - great sightings! Thanks for sharing. Is this the first time you've been at the connection? If so very lucky to get three sightings in one night!

No, I've taken the bus a few times. That was the longest I'd ever had to wait though. Regardless, it was all very lucky!
