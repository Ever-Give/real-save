Oh wow, that is so not acceptable. NO ONE has the right to spread my stuff around without my permission. Does anyone have a profile on that site? Could you please message the guy that I want it taken down? I like the community in here, and I thought I could trust you guys to keep it to yourself. It's the only place I've uploaded it, so it must be someone from here.

If it isn't taken down asap, well, at least I'll know never to post anything online again.
