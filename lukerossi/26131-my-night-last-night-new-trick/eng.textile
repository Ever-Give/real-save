So two nights ago, my partner tried to suprise me by wetting on a rug in our lounge room as we'd booked in a carpet cleaner to do our whole house the next day. I guess she got stage fright though and couldn't do it. So promised she'd make up for it.

So last night was it and I knew it was coming so I drunk a few beers and made sure I had a full bladder. Now my partner knows I enjoy seeing her pee herself but I've never really told her I enjoy wetting myself.

So... I was wearing a tee shirt, black underwear and black PJ bottoms when she let me into the bathroom. At first she tried to strip me down, but I wouldn't have it. Instead I sat on the ground in the bathroom and pulled her so she was standing over me.

As she wet her purple panties I made sure I was in the cross fire, then without her even knowing I began peeing and did so for maybe 45 seconds. Long after she'd finished.

She said "wow I didn't realise I went that much" haha. It felt amazing.

Meanwhile I'm now away in this hotel room with work and plan to enjoy it. Even contemplating posting photos or a video if anyone is keen for it.
