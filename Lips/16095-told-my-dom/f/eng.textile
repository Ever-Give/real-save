Hello guys! long time no see eh? :D

Hmm..i don't know how to start this off (I'm bad at starting things off)...But i'll try anyway.

I told my guy (Who's also my Dom) whom I've been with for a month now ( we were friends before, don't worry...he's also my dom) that I was into peeing...the best thing is, he's into peeing as well (other types of peeing that's not specifaccly omorashi) and I also told him i was into peeing, but I didn't say a certain type until tonight.

It all started off as we were just talking about variety of things, and you know how sometimes people go silent over the phone? Yeah, it was like that. So I decided to say something about my certain fetish (omorashi). Now mind you, I was planning on holding tonight - Still am, actually, I'm doing it right now as I type this.

And due to him being an open-minded person and he was already into peeing, he has no problem with it. And to make things better, we even discussed some of the things to torture my bladder.

Um.. Don't know what else to put here regarding to this xD but I would like to answer some questions if you may have any? (I don't know :P )
