Convenience wetting

I love reading stories about convenience wetting, or just being too lazy to get up, but I feel like unless you're wearing a dress/skirt, a swim suit, or diapers, the cleanup later will be more work than just going in the toilet.

On nights before I know I'm going to wash my sheets, if I wake up and need to go, I'll just let go right there and go back to sleep. Other times if I know I have to do laundry, I'll hold it until I start leaking before I get up and either soak myself in the shower or sitting on the toilet without pulling my pants down. I just can't let it go on the couch where I'm sitting though.

What are your suggestions for ways to make it more convenient without having to deal with the cleanup?
