Stuck doing something, and ending up wet

Sitting on my couch this morning putting a fresh coat of black on my fingernails, my 3 cups of coffee made their way through me and I had to pee pretty badly in no time at all. I was just wearing jeans, as I had just got out of the shower a half hour before. If you've every painted your nails, you know how long it takes to put on a couple of coats and wait for it to fully dry. If you try to do anything, you'll mess them up and have to redo them.

I thought about just stepping back in the shower and soaking my jeans, which would have been fun, except I'd have to sit on the couch again and get pee all over it. So I just held it until I could get my pants down. I also share a house with someone who doesn't need to see me sitting on the cough in wet pants.

Has anyone else been stuck doing something, and decided just to pee their pants/panties instead of trying to leave what they are doing?
