Bride desperate to pee

Hi, yesterday a male friend of mine told me about his wedding.

He came home with his wife by car, driven by someone else.

(I know the distance from where they had the party to their home, I think it should be 40 minutes or less) His wife had to pee really bad by the time they arrived and then they didn't find the keys. So she did a frantic pee dance in front of the door and after they found out that the keys must have been forgotten at the party and they had to wake up the neighbour (there was a second key) she said that she couldn't wait a second longer, went a few steps into the garden and peed there in full sight of the driver. It must have been a close call especially with the wedding dress which wasn't easy to lift up. But I couldn't ask for more details.

I wondered how often a bride may be desperate to pee? Any experiences?
