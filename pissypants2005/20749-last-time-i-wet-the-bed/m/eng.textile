Last time I wet the bed

So this happened about two years ago. I went to bed and was feeling pretty horny. I was thinking about how nice it would feel to wet myself. I had to pee a little, so I let the pressure form against my bladder.

Fast forward about an hour. In a state of semiconscious I think about peeing myself. At once, I wake up. My underwear (that's all I was wearing) was soaked. As much as I wish I could have enjoyed the experience, I couldn't. I was quite concerned. I hadn't had an accident since I was a kid. I turned on the light and examined the damage. A patch about the size of a large dinner plate was on the bed. It appears that I managed to wake up before completely emptying my bladder. I went to empty the rest of my bladder, changed the sheets and went back to bed.

As the title suggests this was the last time I wet the bed. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, but the embarrassment of the act prevailed.
