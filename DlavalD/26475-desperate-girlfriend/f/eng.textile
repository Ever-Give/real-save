That only happens a few months ago, me and my gf were in a square, chatting, at first quite serious cause we had an argument the day before but then tense goes down and the sun too, we watch the sunset and drink a beer with friends, I think this is when she started mentionning her need, of course I made sure she does not get dehydrated by offering her my water bottle really often.

By the time we go out the square she was already really desperate and bouncing around which made me really horny (she knows it), then, badluck for her, we meet another friend of us at the exit of the square, he happened to be really talkative and not letting us go I kept the conversation going while keeping an eye on her desperation.

Then we started heading to her home, which was quite close but we walked slowly.

When we reach her door she was really bursting, I started ticlking her while she struggles with her keys, when she finally managed to open the door I oppose her against a wall, kiss her passionately, cherish her, .. I could feel her bladder swollen and hard as a rock (so was I) with my hand. Each time she tries to escape I block her way and kiss, tease her, ..

Then she managed to get to her little garden and squat down but I started rubbing her clit and kissing her before she pees and she could only spurt a little in my hand, she was getting half mad at me but she could see how horny I got from her situation and she kinda enjoyed it.

After a while as she could not pee even she was extremely bursting cause I was too close, I stepped back and she totally flooded the garden ground, after that we had crazy good sex on a couch and we went out and find a rabbit in the street, crazy day/night !

That was the only time I saw her that desperate and my best experience irl with someone else regarding omorashi, she's not into pee stuff but we have great sexual drive together and I guess we likes soft sado maso roles play like that.

Sorry for my english, it's not my mother tongue, hope you enjoyed reading that as I enjoyed living it :p

Passion is excessive and violent when it reachs higher levels, I won't say what I did was "good" regarding to moral precepts but it felt awesomely "good" for both of us.

Fire burns but sometimes it's good to get burnt. This event cames at a point in our relation when she felt that I wasn't devoting completely to her cause I was repressing my dominant side and somehow she felt I was unsure, too kind, after this event it unlocked new paths in our relationship so I think that was a good (efficient) thing for us in this precise context.

Altrought I won't have done so regardless to her feelings, the context, .. that will be rude and selfish..

(What I'm trying to say is that I'm aware that my behavior was kind of edgy at this time, and most of the time I'll agree it's not a good way to interact with most people but in that precise context I take responsability for what I've done without remorses nor guiltyness)
