These pictures are a bit old and I took them back then to send them to someone, but I've decided to upload them to celebrate the fact that I now own exactly one pair of casual pants my size. Seriously. I need jeans.

I've been trying to make a decent video ever since, but I always ended up being out of frame or with really odd lighting. Not sure if I should bother.

Thank you for the pictures, a really nice wet patch.

Don't give up hope on a video, try doing a rehearsal without peeing and see if you can get the angle and lighting right before you do the pee, see if that works.

Good luck!

That's... actually a good idea. I've thought about it before, but I've always been too lazy so I ended up skipping around trying not to wet myself while trying to adjust the camera.

I don't know how to cut videos, either. I should probably google it. And clean up my room so I don't have half my belongings in the frame. Wouldn't want someone to recognize me by my teddy bear carpet.

I know, but I can't edit or delete that post, so...

Oswin, you are beautiful and I'd love to see a video of this.

Cool --- Thinking of you trying not to wet yourself and ending up wetting is a turn-on. I haven't wet myself while trying hard not to since I was in elementary school, in class. It was fun.

Oh... I have, but usually, it involves holding.
