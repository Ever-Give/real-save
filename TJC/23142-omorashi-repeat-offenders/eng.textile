When I was in school I saw many "repeat offenders". By repeat offenders I mean students who always seemed to be desperate. My question to you guys is; is there/was there a person in your life who constantly was desperate and or having accidents? Here's my story on the subject.

In grade 10 I had a girl in my final two classes of the day, math and art. She was a beautiful Persian girl with long black hair and a skinny build. She said she drank 8 bottles of water a day, and her bottle was a lot bigger than the plastic 500ml. In both classes she would ask to use the bathroom almost daily. During a few occasions during serious evaluations and when the teachers got fed up she'd get extremely desperate and even exclaimed loudly how "she was about to pee her pants"
