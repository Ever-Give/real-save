Both 'real' accidents happened when I was young.....when I was 7 I recall wearing a red jumped and I had pool floaties on my feet since I was pretending to be a mermaid, but I couldn't get them off in time and I wet myself. When I was 6, I know I was wearing a pj top and pants, but I can't recall what they looked like, and I started wetting myself upstairs, stopped, ran downstairs and kept wetting myself until I was empty in front of the downstairs toilet.
