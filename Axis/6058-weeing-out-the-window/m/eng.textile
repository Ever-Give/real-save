So I am in my basement which is like a small living room with carpet and such when I got a strong urge to pee. Instead of going upstairs to the toilet, I decided to open up the large front window and let loose. I was extremely nervous about being seen or someone coming downstairs, so I put it off until I started dribbling in my pjs. I was very slow and cautious, so by the time I got my wang out I was bursting. Even so, I couldn't pee for the longest time. Eventually, my bladder got the best of me and I started going. What a relief it was I almost didn't care if I was seen. I shook off the last few drops and pulled up my pjs. I sighed happily and smiled, leaving only a wet bush in my yard as evidence.

Just did it again. Man that is a nerve-racking way to pee!
