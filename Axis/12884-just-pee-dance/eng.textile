So, one day my brother and I were in the basement playing Just Dance 4 (it's fun don't judge). It was on the Kinect so it required me to stand up to set it up, while my brother sat behind me. I had to pee but I knew I'd be OK once I could start dancing. However, my bladder had other plans.

I was scrolling through the song choices when all of a sudden, I felt it. My dam burst and the town was being flooded. I looked down and had no choice but to watched the pee snake down my legs. I knew I had to excuse myself, and fast. I told my brother I had to go to the bathroom and calmly walked upstairs, still peeing for all I was worth.

In the living room, my mom and little sister were watching TV. I tried to run up before they saw me, but my sister turned around and asked why my pants were wet. My mom either didn't hear her or didn't care (thank God). I then ran up to my room and got changed.

Hope you enjoyed. Thanks for reading!
