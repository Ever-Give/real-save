Should've Knocked on Wood

Just yesterday I posted somewhere that I haven't had an accident since I was a kid and now my bladder's too strong for me to have one. That day a friend and I were having a holding contest and she thought it'd be funny to wait to tell me I had won. When she finally did, I was beyond desperate and I barely made it.

So, today my bladder was very weak, and on the bus ride home from school I felt my bladder filling up. I tried to clench my bladder muscles, but they were too tired from yesterday. I had to just sit there and feel my bladder threaten to release, knowing I wouldn't be able to stop it. Only blocks from my house, I started peeing and, try as I might, I couldn't stop the flow. I let it all come out as I felt it snake down my legs.

When I finally stopped, the stain went all the way down to my cuffs. Luckily, it was all in the front so people that were on the bus wouldn't be able to see unless they looked back. I hurried off the bus and was relieved (again lol) to see that my mom wasn't home yet. I rushed upstairs and washed my wet clothes. When my mom got home she asked why the washer was running and I told her I wanted to do something nice for her. I did wash a load with my clothes, but that was mostly to keep her from getting suspicious.
