Starting early in the morning I awoke, desperate for a pee.

With no plans for the day I decided to try a hold, beginning with 2 large cups of coffee I avoided my family and went up to my room. My bladder was already hurting. I began reading and managed to kill 20mins or so before I realised, hold or not I should get ready for the day. Downing a glass of water I went into the bathroom bladder quivering and got into the shower. Warm water running all over me. My legs scissors almost involuntarily and i held myself tight as pee spurred out of me.

I managed to control it and got out oftheshower quickly drying myself and getting dressed. No sooner had I got dressed I felt pee spurtting into my boxers. Holding myself and slowly hopping from one foot to the other, I became aware that there was no distance left in the hold. I dived back in the bathroom and slowly relaxed my bladder, pee pouring out of me for at least one minute.

Stripping of it got into the shower for the second time, after tossing my clothes in the wash I got dressed but slipped on an adult pull up, I'm going to meet friends this afternoon and im gonna use the opportunity of tired bladder, diapers and the omo' mood im in.

In fact imfeeling adventurous... Any ideas of stuff I can do? dares? Challenges?
