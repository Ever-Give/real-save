I love desperate gaming! I'm very happy to see that I'm not the only woman who likes combining these 2 sources of fun.

Cool story. I sometimes like to play games when I'm holding, along the lines of 'if I can win this level, I can pee/ move onto something else'. It never works out very well though cos the more desperate I get the worse I am at playing games, so I usually never end up winning!

Haha, that's cool ;)
