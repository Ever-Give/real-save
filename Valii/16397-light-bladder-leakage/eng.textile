Hey Guys!

So I am looking for anyone who has an experience with wetting or desperation while wearing a tina (or similar) pad because they have leakage problems. Let me give you an example below.

A story about someone who has a weak bladder and sometimes has some wee leak out if they laugh or cough so often wear an incontinence pad like one of those TINA light bladder leakage pads. Then one day they are out with friends and laugh a bit too much and have a small spurt, later on however they become desperate and leak into their pad. Something like that.

Thanks in advance!
