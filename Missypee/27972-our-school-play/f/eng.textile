We had finished our term exams and still had a couple of days to go before we went on 2 weeks school holidays .

Miss H , had been so impressed with our results she arranged for us to have a " free dress " day which was a huge privilege in our usual strict uniform enforced school .

I wore my favourite jeans, they fitted me as if they were painted on , and were so comfy . All of us relished the chance to get out of our stuffy uniforms for once , no one came dressed in school uniform .

Our main focus was to run over the next terms work which was starting to get a bit boring for all of us .

Miss H , could sense this , so she suggested we do a few skits and asked for volunteers. Straight away Joel put his hand up , so did I , I loved drama .

I had the " hots " for Joel so any time I could spend with him was gold for me .

Joel was our class clown , but he was also very smart , had a razor sharp wit and more than once told me that he liked me . He really was the only guy in the class that I was interested in .

We teamed up together to put little skit into play .

We decided to do our own fractured version of Romeo and Juliette , and to complicate it we would reverse roles, I would play Romeo and Joel Juliette .

To make ourselves look even sillier , we would use " Olde English Speak " just for fun . Neither of us knew the story that well, so its was going to be funny to act which was our intention anyway .

We started bumbling and over acting every part of our version of the famous love story .

Joel's voice was breaking , so one minute he was Barry White deep , then the next he was Celine Dion screeching high , but Joel being Joel played upon his new transition into adult male hood as a tool to amuse .

We were getting a lot of laughs from our hastily prepared production so it was time to do the famous scene

Joel flung his arms wide apart as if in distress and uttered

" Romeo "

" Romeo "

" Where FART !!! thou Romeo " with his voice surrendering his maleness just long enough for Celine Dion to materialise

The whole class roared with laughter , even Miss H was in raptures and had tears rolling down her cheeks .

I just lost it , the timing was so perfect , I broke into hysterics , I had no idea he was going to say that , let alone have his voice break at the precise moment to make the " fluff ' word so pronounced .

I had crossed my legs and had forced my hands tight into myself in a vain attempt to preserve my dignity .

I started to wet myself , a trickle at first , then a releasing flood as I felt my jeans fill with hot pee . I could do nothing , paralysed with laughter my bladder surrendered in spectacular fashion as I became the " encore "

The class focus now firmly on me disgracing myself , brought even more laughter , for a brief time I laughed with them , until reality set in and I realised I had just wet myself in front of the entire class .

My tears of laughter quickly became tears of shame as I made a wet sloshy exit from the class to the bench outside our room , sat down and bawled my eyes out .

I couldn't believe my day had gone from a spiralling high to a crashing low in such a short time .

Miss H came out to see me , put her arm around me to try and console the blubbering wreck I had become .

She suggested we go to the "lost property " room first to see if there was anything I could change into , there wasn't , so I had no choice but stay in my soaking jeans .

She took me to the Head Masters office where they rang mum to come and pick me up . Mum couldn't get there for an hour , so I was left sitting in the waiting room to stew in my own juices .

The registrar walked past me several times , I could see the look on her face " Isn't she a bit old to be wetting herself " , I could read her mind . !!

Mum collected me , I sat in silence the way home , I hated myself .

Joel rang me that night to see how I was going , I thought that was really sweet of him and it did brighten my mood .

I didn't go to school until school holidays started , then with 2 weeks off I had hoped the class would forget my accident .

Miss H , threatened the class with " serious consequences " if anyone teased me when I returned .

Apart from a few snide comments I escaped ridicule when I returned .

That was the last time I wet my pants in class

Yes it does actually , what's the point of being sad about it , I have told some of my friends over the years who also think it was really funny

That would have been funny, as it was I did laugh at myself briefly until reality set in . I remember Joel staring at me with a sort of stunned look on his face, well he was funny enough to make me wet my pants. So I guess he played his part out in full and accidently I added more humour at my own expense .
