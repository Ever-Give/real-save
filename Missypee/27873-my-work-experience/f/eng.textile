My Work Experience

Our school had a program called "Work Experience " where employers would give up some of their time to take on students and help integrate them into future employment .

I didn't really know what I wanted to do , so I took a position with a young guy who was kind enough to lend some time to the program . His name was Rob , and he was just starting out selling insurance by himself .

He actually wanted someone part time to look after his office while he was out , take messages etc. . In the mean time he thought he would give me a go to see if his idea was worth putting into place .

I arrived at his office at a little bit before 9.00 am , dressed in my smartest black skirt and white top only to find no sign of my new boss . I was so nervous this being my first venture into the big wide world , my stomach churned as I hoped I would cope with greeting and meeting adults . I really had no idea what to expect .

Rob turned up 10 minutes late in a mad panic , he had to meet a client in 15 minutes and of course he didn't want to get off on the wrong foot with them by being late .

He took me into his office and gave me the quickest ever orientation , showed me the appointment book , left a card with his phone number , said he would be back in an hour and like a whirlwind he was gone , leaving me to gather my thoughts of " OMG what have I got myself into !!! "

I took stock of my position , the first thing was I needed to pee !! , I entered Rob's office expecting to see a door leading to the washroom or bathroom . Instead a sink and a little place to make tea and coffee was all I found and a rather messy office . The obvious domain of an unorganised male !!!

Now I started to stress , what do I do if I need to go to the bathroom , I tried to remember if Rob had mentioned anything in his lightning fast " welcome to my world "

Did I even have a key ................. No . So I couldn't leave the office without locking myself out even if I knew where the nearest toilet was .

I took a deep breath , calmed down , ok ................

Can I wait an hour ? ....................... I already knew the answer , No ! I looked at my watch , he has only been gone 10 minutes !!!!

Can I pee in the sink ? ............ seriously I even considered it , No !! A rubbish bin , I checked , it had holes in it !!!

So tidied up , trying to keep my mind off my wayward bladder until I thought of someway I could relieve myself .

By now I was kicking myself for not being more forward and asking to obvious question .

" What do I do if I need to pee ? " but it was too late now .

My first customer entered , a middle aged guy with an inquiry about some business insurance , I bluffed my way though and took as many of his details as I could think of and made an appointment for him .

I was so pleased with myself , it took my mind off needing to pee even if it was briefly .

A couple of more guys entered and I did my best to look as if I had been working there for months . As I took their details I tried hard not to let them see me squirming under my desk , I kept wanting to dive my hand under my desk to every time I got the sharp urge to pee , but I kept my legs squeezed tight together .

Then nobody ........... I was left pacing around the office trying not to think of my bladders growing need to empty itself . I looked at my watch , nearly an hour gone !

OMG ........... I am so desperate , I was terrified of wetting my pants . How would that look on my very first day .

I sat at my chair trying to find a position that wasn't so uncomfortable , but my efforts were in vain .

I thought I felt a slight warming sensation in my panties , I run my fingers over my underwear ............. wetness !!!!!! I had started to leak .

I prayed now that no one would come in because for the first time I knew I was going to wet my pants and there nothing I could do to prevent it .

More warmth , I clenched down as hard as I could even pushing both hands onto my skirt , now I could feel the first trickle of pee under my bum .

I was slowly losing control , wetting myself in slow motion . I felt like crying but I called on my inner strength to keep myself together .

Then the sharpest pang of urgency , my bladder had become tired and in a last ditch effort had quivered into submission !!

I felt the hottest flush of pee boil into my panties , flooding all under me and pattering on the carpet underneath my chair .

I was wetting myself !!

I dropped my head onto my desk , almost in tears of disbelief . I lay there feeling sorry for myself before realising I had to snap out of my misery and learn to cope with another accident .

My skirt was saturated , but I hoped that it was dark enough to not show .

Then I used all the tissues on my desk to attempt to mop up the puddle under my chair , but the carpet was a light grey and despite my best efforts still showed my pee stain . I patted my skirt and knickers dry as best I could , but I could still smell pee .

Rob returned , immediately apologetic , he had realised he had gone off and not left me a key or shown me where the bathrooms were .

Then he saw the waste paper basket full of yellow stained tissues and he turned bright red , I could do nothing as the overwhelming embarrassment got the better of me as tears trickled down my cheeks .

Rob had realised his mistake had made me wet my pants . He said " I am so sorry " before opening his wallet then giving me some money and told me " to go and get what ever I needed "

I continued to face him , I couldn't bear to show him my wet skirt , though I hoped nothing showed .

At first I just wanted to hop on the nearest bus and go home , but I plucked up the courage to go shopping for a new dry outfit .

I have to say standing in line at the checkout smelling of pee with a new skirt and panties in front of other people was a very embarrassing moment . It would have been even more so if I had have realised that my skirt did show a sizable wet patch still and I only found out after I went to clean up and change .

I returned to the office still smarting from my accident , Rob bought me lunch , it was a peace offering although I wasn't angry at him .

He commended me on handling the office the way I did despite being "dropped in at the deep end" as he put it .

I got to work for him after school , so I was glad I had overcome my very humiliating start and his very first thing he did ............... he presented me with my very own key to the office .

My wetting accident was never mentioned again .

That is so true , even though it was his mistake , he really did go out of his way to help me out . It was one of the reasons I stayed and not just walked out . It also taught me to cope when I have had an accident in public life .

Not that time , there wasn't anything sexual in it for me , but other public wettings yes , it does arouse me . Now the thought of doing it in public and being seen ,even when I cant help it does push my buttons

I don't know what it is about that age , but I was certainly pee shy , another stage I went through .................. I was embarrassed by the noise of peeing in the toilet , so I would run off a heap of toilet paper and throw it into the bowl to deaden the noise of me going to the loo . Everyone has to go at some stage and we all make a noise , just a weird stage I went through .
