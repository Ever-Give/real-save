During my "reckless " twenties I went through a period where my drinking was getting out of control.

I didn't really care who saw me because I would often wet my pants, sometimes without knowing and sometimes I would do it on purpose.

Eventually after a few drinks I would get horny and start to hold on to my wee on purpose , I just loved having the sensation of a full bladder .

One night out, I was wearing a pair of black vinyl pants I had just bought, they felt so sexy with a full satin lining gliding over my skin as I walked . So as the night wore on I got more daring . My inhibitions washed away by alcohol , I became more brazen . I was busting to pee having held on way past my safe limit, so rather wait for the never ending line to gradually and painfully grow shorter I moved to a quieter darker part of the club .

My heart raced as I thought about what I was about to do , I kicked off my shoes .............. took a deep breath and started to wet myself !! Oh it was the most amazing feeling , my pee had nowhere to escape so it flooded up around my bum, some escaped from the seam but most slowly soaked its way down my satin lined legs and puddled around my feet.

Then I would walk nonchalantly over to some carpet , dry my feet , put my shoes back on and walk off as if nothing had happened . As soon as I had to pee again I would do the same , they became my favourite clubby pants , so sexy on the outside , so sopping with pee on the inside . It really was the most gorgeous sexy naughty feeling . Walking around in saturated panties and pants without anyone knowing , sometimes I couldn't wait to get home to ............

Well it doesn't take too much to work out

I still have them , and I do sometimes put them on and pee in them to reminisce . I was never groped ............ unfortunately , no seriously I didn't go out of my way to find a guy . I was more interested in getting drunk than looking for a partner for the night . Sometimes I would have loved to found somewhere out of sight to play , but prefer to do it at home where I can really express myself without being heard
