Lauren and I were house mates , neither of us could be bothered cooking dinner so we decided to treat ourselves to a night out with a few drinks and dinner .

We went to our local tavern for a couple of pre dinner drinks before moving on to a restaurant we had booked earlier.

We were chatting away when a couple of guys came and sat with us , they introduced themselves to us . Both were fly in fly out mine workers , their names were Mathew and Tyson . Both guys were best mates with rugged good looks caught our interest almost immediately .

The drinks flowed , the guys kept us entertained to the point where we nearly forgot our dinner date .

Lauren and I went to the toilet to " compare notes " we were both excited by our new love interests , so we decided to ask them if they would join us for dinner .

I had my eyes on Matt , and Lauren had taken a liking to Tyson . The guys jumped at the chance to join us , so off we went .

Somehow it felt right , the guys made us laugh and they didn't seem to be coming with us with only one thing in mind .

Our night was a huge success , so we swapped phone numbers and agreed to see each other again . We only had a few days to get to know each other before the guys had to return to work .

It was a long few weeks before the guys came back . I spent most of the day with Matt but I was reluctant to spend a night with him in case my " problem " resurfaced and I would ruin our relationship before it had begun .

Even Lauren wouldn't sleep with me unless I wore a diaper . I am an occasional bedwetter , unless I have been drinking then I am a frequent bedwetter .

I had only started wearing diapers at night again since I moved in with Lauren . I had tried sleeping with guys before , of course I never worked up the courage to tell them about my bladder issues and after a night out I would lay awake stressing about peeing myself in my sleep and then having to explain myself in the morning . Eventually after a few near sleepless nights I would be so tired I would collapse into a coma like slumber and wether I had been drinking or not I would wake in a wet bed .

The friction it caused in our relationship would soon form cracks which would then turn into chasms , we would fight and argue about seemly stupid issues , then my bedwetting would come up and eventually we would go our own separate ways and I would be single and unhappy again.

This time it would be different , I would not sleep over until I thought I knew Matt well enough to explain my situation to him . Then if he wanted to call it off I would be hurt but I would rather it be that way then a painful split again .

Matt and I were messing around . Matt was lying on the floor , I was straddling him . He only wearing jeans so I started kissing his chest . He wasn't wearing underwear , something that I found really sexy .

So I began to put that situation to good use , I was feeling oh so horny, I lowered myself onto his man thing and began slowly and gently rocking my hips , so as to rub his jeans up and down on his ever expanding member .

I really needed to pee but I also loved the feeling of having a full bladder and the exciting horny sensation I was getting .

I could feel myself getting wet , I was teasing Matt , getting him almost to the edge and then backing off to deny him . I was really enjoying having a man in my life again .

Matt sensed I was teasing him , so he grabbed me and began tickling me so hard it made me breathless .

I couldn't get the words out I was so desperately trying to say

" Stop or I am going to wet myself " !!!!

I was straddled which left me helplessly defenceless ............................. Too Late !!!!!

I felt a hot gush of pee flood into my jeans , Matt kept tickling unaware of what had just happened , then stopped with a startled look on his face .

I sat stunned and helpless as my bladder emptied itself into my underwear and now soaking through to Matt's proud member .

My relationship was melting away or so I thought , I looked at Matt , expecting a tirade of abuse .

Nothing !!! except a guy looking very embarrassed with the biggest man toy I had ever seen .

OMG !!! my horniness returned in a flash , I couldn't help myself . I ripped open his jeans , exposing him .

Then dragged my own jeans down my legs , not even bothering to remove my panties , I just yanked them to one side and then directed his member into my flooded garden .

We made love like a couple possessed , frantic , wild and untamed !!!

I felt his warm seed explode inside me , which triggered my own intense shattering orgasm . Every fibre in my body screamed in pent up release !!!!

As I dug my nails deep into his chest .

Panting I collapsed onto his chest , enjoying the wilting afterglow . I kissed him lovingly , thankful to be still together after peeing on my new boyfriend .

He quietly whispered to me

" Where the F**k did that come from ? "

I whispered quietly back

" You made me wet my pants "

We have to talk "

We got up and went and showered , I was in a dream , I had just had the best sex with a guy ever !!

We showered and in the middle of the day climbed into bed . I had already sensed that Matt was easy to talk to .

Ok he said tell what just happened .

So I confessed " peeing myself turns me on " as soon as I said that I could feel his " barometer " rise . Matt was turned on by me peeing on him .

He confessed he was embarrassed because he got a hard on when I peed all over him and thought I would be angry for making me piss my pants .

Matt had never had any involvement with pee sex , it was totally new to him .

Seizing my chance I went for broke , we talked for hours I shared my bladder issues with him even confessing that I wore diapers at night .

Matt didn't even know they made "adult diapers" , we shared our kinks and we finally realised we had something special between us .

That was over 5 years ago , our relationship has continued to flourish , even though at times its still long distance , our week together is so much fun .

Its the happiest I have ever been . Lauren and I are still in regular contact so we don't get lonely when our guys are away .

I am so glad we decided to go to dinner that night , it changed my life forever .

Some things are meant to be !!

Thankyou , its not perfect , we do spend a lot of time apart but we think of it as having a weeks holiday every month and its almost like starting over again .

No , I'm from the West , Flower and your right there is issues with layoffs etc . So far we are ok although I am not getting as many hours myself . I work in HR and are also connected to mining, so yes, anxious times for all of us .

So we try to stay positive , and concentrate on what we have at the moment and each other . Then worry if the crunch comes later .

We certainly are glad to see each other , a month is a long time between ..................... well I'm sure you have a fair idea

Yes so do I , but we make the most of what we have already .................absence makes the heart grow fonder
