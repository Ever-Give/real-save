Peed myself at the Queen concert

I had booked tickets for the Queen concert a few months back , unfortunately my boyfriend Matt was away at work so he couldn't come . So I took my best friend along instead . Lauren and I hadn't caught up a for awhile so we booked a room in the city near the Arena where the concert was going to be held . Its a new venue so I didn't have any idea where we would be seated or anything .

Once inside I couldn't help being impressed by the design , we had a quick look around to check out which section we would be in then decided on a couple of drinks and a catch up on all the gossip .

It was nearly time for the concert to start , so I found a toilet before there was a line up . I knew I had "broken the seal " but I didn't have much choice . I practically bounced up and down on the toilet seat making sure I had voided my tiny bladder as best I could .

We entered through one of the side entrances near our block and found our way up a narrow set of steps then along our row of seats . The seats were so close together and we already had to squeeze past a few people to get to our seats which happen to be almost in the middle of the row .

I was surprised on how steep the sides of the "Cauldron " were but never the less the whole place was very impressive .

The concert started with a huge roar from the crowd as their new front man Adam Lambert bounced onto stage .

The atmosphere was truly electric with a stunning light show and the usual glitz and glamour that queen was so famous for . Freddie would have been so proud as his memory was so beautifully portrayed by the "New Guy"

I love live concerts especially when its a famous band that we hardly get the chance to see , living so far away from the rest of the world .

A few songs in and my bladder began to niggle me , I ignored it . I was beginning to regret have a couple of preshow drinks with Lauren , maybe it wouldn't get any worse and I could just sit on it until the break . Of course I was kidding myself , soon I had snuck my hands down to my crotch just to add a little pressure and maybe subdue the urgency signals that somehow were now coming on strong . A few more songs and still no sign of the band wanting to take a break , I was now uncomfortable enough to start to worry . I looked up at the narrow dark path I had to somehow squeeze down, apologising to all the people who had to move their feet to let me through . Wondering what names they were calling me under their breath . Lauren seemed oblivious to my distress until I whispered to her " I need to GO !!! hoping she needed a wee too and she would come too . I really hate going on my own .

To my surprise she said she was ok , " can you hold on ? "

" I will try "

I was now constantly moving in my seat , my legs unconsciously bounced up and down and I began to butterfly my knees , then I little warm sensation in my panties , I felt it soak through my jeans with my hand .

OMG I have to go or I am going to wet myself !!

I got up , and began to side step my way past all the suitably unimpressed people still trying to enjoy the concert , now down the steps following a little line of lights . It was steep and I hated the dark but I was driven by fear alone , I didn't want to sit in wet jeans for the rest of the concert or worse still miss the rest all together .

I paused at the bottom of the steps near the exit just to gather my composure and the step the next little wet wave of urgency that had just swept over me .

" I am going to be ok , I can make it " Pray girl !!! ....................like you have never prayed before I thought . Please god keep my pants dry !!

I moved out of the exit , now holding myself aware of the wetness in my panties

The first toilet I came across was one for the handicapped , I had no time to be politically correct , I was wetting myself .

I burst through the door as my bladder was starting to give up the fight , I could feel the wetness on my hand , I battled to get my jeans down with one hand holding on to stem the flow with the other .

I got my jeans down enough to collapse onto the toilet and finally relieve myself . Ohhhhhhhhhh it felt so good , but I hadn't totally made it , my panties were soaked and my jeans had a sizable wet patch in the crotch radiating down my thighs .

OMG what am I going to do , I took my jeans and panties off and dried myself off , I have spare knickers in my bag , but what about my jeans .

I spied a hand dryer on the wall , quickly I pressed it and held my jeans under to try and dry them a little bit to make the wet spot less noticeable . A couple more restarts and my defacto clothes dryer had my jeans dry enough so the stain had faded .

I put some dry knickers on and placed some hand towel into my crotch to save my new panties from getting wet .

Queen were still playing so I hung back until the break .

I wasn't in a big hurry to attempt to regain my seat in the dark .

At the break Lauren found me ,

"What happened to you ? " she was worried , I didn't have time to tell her I was going to the loo , I thought she would have guessed when I left in a hurry .

I moved my bag aside , I was using it hide my now fading wet spot . She giggled at my misfortune .

Even though I had to sit through the rest of the concert in damp jeans I really did enjoy the rest of the show , but next time I wont ignore my urges for so long .

Lesson learnt !!

OMG I didn't know that , I would have been in deep trouble because there is no way I could have made it any further . I was just grateful that I had some space to take my jeans off and dry them . That would have been impossible in a normal cubical . I was truly terrified of having a major accident , not that I mind peeing myself in public , I just didn't want it to happen then and there . I really think I had a lucky escape

I was terrified I don't mind admitting , I was so close to completely wetting myself , I really did push my bladder to its limit , which isn't very much .

The next concert we went to I did , this time Matt was with me . I am going to write about that one too .

I quiet often use handicap toilets, especially if I have to change my diapers . They are roomy and have sanitary bins provided for just that purpose . I hope they never bring that rule in here , I would never deny a handicap person their right to use their own loo , I would rather wait and risk wetting myself , but I understand that some people mustn't think that way

Yes I do always carry spare knickers , because I am prone to leaking and there is always the other unwelcome surprise I sometimes get

Maybe that's a good question to ask us female members , " Who does carry spare knickers or at least a spare pair " ?

I have always carried spare knickers too , and I have had to use them . I thought it was the "done" thing , my BBF does as well . Sometimes you just cant go " Commando "

Adam Lambert was singing for this tour anyway , and he was simply brilliant . Without him I don't think it would have been the success it was

I am sure there are dedicated fans at most concerts , when you think you may never get the chance to see your favourite band play a certain song live again its a small sacrifice to pay . If its open air then it happens more than you think . AC/DC concert 2010 , danced with my black jeans soaked to my ankles . So dark and so many people I couldn't get to the toilet even if I wanted to , so I gave up
