Caught short in the rain

I used to live in Taiwan, where most people ride lightweight scooters and heavy rain comes and goes suddenly and unpredictably. Scooter rides are bumpier than car rides and I would hold my pee at work and then try to make it home.

One hot summer afternoon, I did my usual hold before leaving work. I only lived about a 15 minute ride from work, so it wasn't not a time issue, but it was an issue of the bumps in the road sending waves of pressure at my full bladder. About halfway on the way back, after going through the tunnel, it started to pour. I didn't have time to put on my rain coat, especially not with my bladder about to burst! I was only 5 minutes from home when the rain got really bad, so I figured I'd make it. I had to drive more slowly than usual because of the slick roads, but I made it home to the parking lot and ran into my apartment building.

As I got out of the elevator and up to my front door, I realized that every inch of my clothing from the neck down was totally soaked and cold from the rain. I decided at that point I may as well enjoy a little wetting fun. I put my helmet down and let the flow go, the warm piss dripping all the way down to my socks and onto the tile floor. I stood there for close to a minute, enjoying the sensation and relief before I finally peeled off all my clothes and went in the front door.
