Hi everyone, I've been absent for a while because I was traveling but I'm back and something happend to me just when I came back home.

The very same day when I return from my vacations I had a pretty bad cold and I was very tired for the very long travel (I can't sleep on planes because they are to much unconfortable), so after almost 30 hours jumping from airport to airport I was exhausted. I buy some pills in Argentina but never took it, a friend of mine took one and told me that he felt high and dizzy but I didn't pay to much of attention because he tend to be a little overreacting, so when I came home I put my luggage on the floor and took 2 cold pills (I ussually take 2 of my regular cold pills) but this ones was like super strong or something, I took my clothes off and went to bed.... 

So... in the middle of the night I wake up because I felt something warm in my pants, but I was so high that even when I open my eyes I was still peeing and I felt like I was dreaming or something, I was able to stop but I swear that it tooks me like 5 or 6 seconds to fully stop peeing. When I check out my pants they were totally soaked, I just couldn't believe it, I didn't wet the bed since I was a little kid.

I don't know for sure that the pills cause it but perhaps the fact that I was sick, exhausted and stoned all at the same time did the trick.

Do you know what was in the pills? I don't know about from Venezuela to Argentina, but from the US to almost anywhere else, cold medicine tends to vary widely in contents. That could possibly explain the effects...

The pills are called Febrigrip and contains: Acetaminophen 300mg, Butetamato citrate 60mg, Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 30mg and Chlorpheniramine maleate 3mg

Not totally sure what Butetamato is, but it looks like the drugs didn't cause the wetting to me, just the sickness. Pseudophedrine is more likely to make you restless as it's a stimulant--which could, in theory, cause you to only be half asleep, which makes it easier for a wetting to take place--and even at double dose, it isn't outside of a regular amount of it. More, and you'd feel speedy. You never know though. Everyone's body composition is different, and yours might have responded to the combination of things by wetting. I guess we could do a wetting fetish double blind trial...

I guess I'll never know, but I am grateful that this thing happend to me at home, if I had wet my bed in the cabin we were staying in front of 5 people I would have died of shame !
