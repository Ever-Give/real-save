This post probably belongs in the "wetting experiences" forum, but I cannot make new threads there.

I was holding today while my brother is at work and I had the house to myself. As usual when I do this, I got myself to the breaking point and rushed to stand in the shower when I couldn't hold on anymore. Whenever I wet, it kind of comes in waves where my body puts extra pressure behind it. During one of these waves, something.... else.... happened. It was the first time i had ever messed myself in my adult life. It caught me completely off-guard. I had to stop everything and check myself to make sure it even really happened and wasn't just gas or something. At that point, the damage was done though, so I decided to just let everything go. Unfortunately, it didn't really make the experience any better. And so, it's time for round 2. I still have a few hours before my brother gets home, So I just chugged a few glasses of water. We'll see if I can have a cleaner experience this time, or if I even have time to make it happen.
