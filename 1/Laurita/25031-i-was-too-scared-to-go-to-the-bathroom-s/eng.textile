Hello! I want to tell you something that happened when I was 14... No one knows it, I felt very ashamed and I didnt tought it to anyone, hope you like it! :)

Well, I was home alone, and I needed to pee so bad, I holded it through hours because I was lazy to go to the bathroom, and when I was on the limit I ran to the toilet.

When I opened the door I saw a very very big spider in the corner above the toilet, I was very very apprehensive toward spiders, so I stopped myself and I stayed on the door a few seconds. I would never peed with a spider above my back, I was a little scared about that, so I waited to see if it goes away. It didn't.

I was at the limit, I knew I was about to pee myself, but I was at the age when you are young but you think you are a full adult, and I would feel humiliated and ashamed if I peed myself for fear...

I runned to the kitchen and grabbed a tupperware, went to my room, putted down to the floor the tupper, took down my pants and panties very very fast, almost tearing them, I crouched above the tupper and all the pee spurt out automatically... I remember it was smelly and yellow, a little warm steam sprout from the hot piss, it was a very very strong stream, and splashed a little at my feet and buttocks...

I was blushing so much, I was ashamed, begging so no one could see me never like that... When all the pee was in the tupper I put my panties and pants again, very quickly, with the crotch still wet (and my panties wetted because I didnt cleaned my zone after peeing...), I grabbed the tupper full of hot and smelly pee and I shed it on the kitchen sink...

No one knows that, you are the first one who I tell that, so please be gentle :$ I hope you liked it, have a nice day <3 :)
