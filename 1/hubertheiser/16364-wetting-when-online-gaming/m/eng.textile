Hi there,

I'm addict to the game of Go, there are days when I do nothing else. As some of you might know, Go players are fueled by lots of coffee, and I mean lots .

Yesterday was such Go day again. The game I was playing was pretty close with complicated positions requiring full concentration, and, as I was in overtime, some quick thinking. The building bladder pressure started to be annoying and increasingly distracting. Playing in overtime means, no time for the loo or you're going to lose on time. So I was nailed to my chair feeling more and more pressure from both the game and my bladder.

Soon I realized that I had a decision to make: either to lose the game or to lose the fight with the bladder. As you might guess, winning a game of Go is more fun than losing it and just giving in to the bladder is more fun than jumping up and running to the loo. So I started wetting while playing, slowly at first, but after a few spurts there was no holding it anymore . My jeans, the chair as well as the carpet got a really thorogh soaking. Unfortunatly, the effects on my private parts where such that they required some immediate attention which made me lose the game.

I guess that's the only way how losing a game of Go still is a lot of fun .

Hope you like, stay wet
