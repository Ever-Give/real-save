I'll keep the story as short as possible. I've been going to the same lady (Danni) for over a year now. She loves to talk while working on me, which I didn't like originally, but realized she will talk about anything and is really fun. Anyway last week when I was there she brought up the fact that she used to be a cocktail waitress at a casino for a few years. I somehow get up the nerve to say I've seen a bunch of women at casinos that have wet their pants. She laughed and said it's a common occurrence. We talked about other casino stuff for a while and I decided the first conversation went well, so I would push it a little.

She knows I've been running a lot. I say to her that I've seen quite a few women that have peed their pants at the end of a race. Some just a little, some a lot. She says yup, it happens. Then she tells me a story about a client of hers. She called her from her car and said she needed to see her right now. She just finished a 5k and pulled a muscle in her leg. When she showed up, she had clearly peed her running pants. Danni brought her in the room and told her to get ready and she would be right in. The lady took off her pants but still had her wet panties on. As she worked on her, she apologized for not going home to get cleaned up first and she would pay extra to clean the sheets. She told her she pushed real hard at the end to the finish and lost control of her bladder, which wasn't the first time.

At this point it was very clear I was enjoying the conversation. Danni made it clear that she would not be helping me out in that area. I guess my point is you never know what will happen if wetting gets brought up in a conversation. I wonder if it will get brought up again next week.

Yes, she knows the topic is what got me going. She certainty wasn't disgusted by it and had no issues about talking about it. I see her again later this week. I'm not sure if I'll bring it up or not. I have a feeling she may be the one that brings it up. She must take notes after every session or she has an amazing memory because she seems to remember everything we talk about.
