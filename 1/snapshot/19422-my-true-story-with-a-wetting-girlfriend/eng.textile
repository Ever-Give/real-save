Hi everyone

I'm going to tell this story in "greentext" format because any kind of embellishment, no matter how well written, will ever do the story justice.

- be about 21 y.o

- hanging at bar after work

- getting pretty drunk

- girl comes up to bar, orders drink

- pretty damn hot, fit

- we flirt, sexual chemistry

- we talk for about ten minutes, make out

- go back to my place, we have sex

- we pass out

- she gets up and pees outside, pops a squat

- comes back in, goes back to sleep

- i notice bed is wet, not much but can tell she must have not finished outside

- think how lucky i am to witness an accident with some random

- fall asleep

- next morning, we exchange numbers, i go to work, she leaves

- fap every day imagining her almost-accident

- she calls three days later

- we set up a date

- we go out to bar, drink a lot, eat food

- back to my place again

- lots of sex

- we pass out, well nearly, im awake but barely

- my hand is resting over her pussy

- hear a noise, it sounds like hissing

- feel warmth on my hand

- no fucking way

- she's peeing

- she's peeing heaps

- in her sleep, in my bed

- i can't fucking believe it

- i crouch down around her pussy

- her pee covers my chest, my body

- saturates the bed, and me

- first time i've ever seen a wetting pussy up close and personal

- first time i've ever been peed on

- i orgasm within 30 seconds

- go have cigarette and wonder how this could be

- how could some random make my fantasies real?

- go back in, see her laying in huge puddle

- go back to sleep (after a wank)

- next morning, she's gone

- check sheets, still damp, didn't dream it

- mattress protector saved bed

- cant stop smiling

- dont hear from her for a week

- she pops round randomly one night

- good to see her

- wonder if she has pee fetish

- decide i need to bring it up

- have dinner and drinks at mine, party, music

- getting intimate

- ask her "so, do you remember what happened the other night"

- no

- "well you had an accident"

- she looks really freaked out

- "you wet the bed baby"

- even more freaked out

- "no no no, i don't want you to worry"

- going to tell her...

- "i liked it, that's my fetish"

- still looks freaked out, i drop it

- we get drunk

- she brings it up, says sorry she "pissed in my bed" (exact)

- i tell her it's alright, i think it's hot

- ask her if she thinks that's weird

- she says she lived with punks once, not weird compared to their crazy tastes

- she says it's not her fetish

- i say maybe it should be, if she regularly wets

- she says i'm lucky i found a wetter

- i totally agree

- we drink more, fool around, have fun

- she takes me outside and pops a squat, lets me watch

- we go back inside, have sex

- go to sleep

- she starts coming around more often

- ends up practically totally living with me

- enjoys the novelty of making me horny with her piss

- wets her pants on purpose for me

- gives me golden showers with her panties still on

- accidentally bedwets a couple of times

- ruins a mattress

- totally worth it

- about six to eight weeks pass

- novelty of pee starts to wear off (for her)

- relationship deteriorates

- she's unemployed

- sticks around for free rent, food

- we have little in common

- lots of arguments

- next to no sex, let alone pee

- we have huge crazy fight

- go to work next day, scratched up face

- confide in a friend, mike, i tell him it's finished

- he calls her up and tells her i don't want her there anymore

- i crack it at him, how dare he, mind your own business,

- but he's right

- she calls me at work, tells me she's leaving

- we both know it's for the best

- we plan to have a big last night together

- lots of booze

- i come home from work with a carton of beer

- we're nice to eachother, solemn but fun

- we agree we've both taken advantage of eachother

- i'm fuming with my friend mike for butting in

- she says forgive him he did what he thought was right

- he calls, says sorry

- she says go over there and make amends

- i do

- mike and i do some coke

- forgive him

- tell him its for the best anyway, relationship was turning toxic

- he has no idea she wets for me and pees on me

- of course i don't tell him

- we do some more coke

- feeling euphoric

- go home

- open the door

- lauren's passed out, she's drank heaps of beer

- she's still in her clothes

- and she's pissed in her pants

- yep, peed in her jeans

- like heaps, and heaps, and heaps

- i hold her gently

- slide my hand on the inside of her thigh

- she's totally drenched

- she must have just wet

- she's literally laying in a puddle

- she wakes up

- i'm hard as a rock, but i try to hide it

- she isn't stupid but she appreciates it

- she bursts into tears, she's really embarrased

- i clean her up, take off her saturated jeans

- tell her she'll be ok

- she thanks me for being so sweet

- tells me she'll miss me

- i tell her i will too

- sleep

- go to work next day

- feel really empty

- come home, she's gone

- written a letter

- makes me sad

- really depressed, really alone

- have a few drinks

- go to sleep

- accidentally wet the bed for the first and only time in my life

- think it's poetic

- never see her again.

The end.

Hehe, I didn't mean to make anyone sad.

It was a long time ago, probably about twelve years.

The reason I didn't go into descriptive mode with the details is that I just wanted to get the story out. Maybe in the future :)
