I think in my live i've seen only 2 real wetting, one was a little girl, around 3 yeras old, but i was like 4 so i didn't pay attention to it, and the other was me in school, i was 5 i thing, and after that i don't remember others, i saw a lot of desesperation back in school because there was a girl with a tinny bladder i think (every day she ran to the batroom on half of the day) but, never wetting :/

About 8 month ago, i was in a plane and, next to me was a little boy that wet himself, but he was with his mother and she, obviusly didn't let me see >_>

Well, this doesn't end here, a week after that, i went to an water park, and there... i thing i miss at least 3 wetting, the two first were two girls like 13, (i think they were twins) and they were "dancing" a bit, we were in a long line, there were 2 other people between us, and i just know that, first they were normal, and then, they were crying and i thing the bathsuit was wet and it wasn't before and then they leave the line, but i was without my fu**ing glasses so i don't know what happened T_T. And after that, i went to other attraction, the same, loooong line, a little girl (same age) and she was crazy for a bathroom, she was doing every "move" to prevent the wetting, and in the last moment, the attraction made some fog for decoration and i couldn't see her, after the fog was gone, she was... yeah, normal T_T, and she was in front of me, but the FU**ING FOG...

Well, i just wanted to tell someone this, what do you think, am I the unluckiest guy in the world or you have passed unluckiest moments?

PS: sorry if i write something wrong, my english isn't perfect :/

Maybe you are just surrounded by lucky people who didn't want to be seen wetting themselves and they weren't =]

}}

But... but... that's unfair ; _;

{{: 

If you mean in regards to wettings witnessed, you are not the unluckiest. I have never seen a wetting in real life. (though I don't count children)

}}

If i don't count children... i've never seen one too :/

{{: 

No you are not that unlucky you got to see some desperation.... Does that not count for something?

I am sure most people on here have had this happen to them/Will have this happen to them at some point in there life.

}}

I like desperations, a lot, but without the wetting i fell like... I'm missing something :/

Well, 4 times in a row is a lot =_=

{{: 

I've never been in the proximity of a girl wetting herself in my life. At any age. I've also never seen a girl nearing that point.

I've been around a couple of guys who have when I was younger however. And there was literally one guy I watched wet himself from laughing. These guys were all younger than 6 though.

I didn't even think that anyone above the age of 6/7 actually had accidents from any reason. I also believed that girls had perfect bladder control and only boys had accidents. :P

}}

I don't like to count guys because i like girls , guys in desperation is disgusting for me :/

{{: 

I work in toddler and preschool child care, so if I did count children, then I've seen numerous wettings :P

}}

I don't like to count children, but those were those were the only ones i've seen xD

I have never gotten to see anyone pee themselves (male or female) but I did get to see one girl get pretty bad off pretty much every day for a while. I sat by a girl my Freshman year of HS and it almost NEVER failed that she had to pee during that class. The group back there would also bother her (there were many jokes and some tickling) but nothing ever came of it, unfortunately.

But no, you're not that unlucky. You keep getting lucky enough to see someone desperate EVENTUALLY you have to run into one that wets themselves.

My class never did that. But one time, when she was going to the bathroom i stoped her to talk about the homework. I was trying to stop her until the class start, but she literally push me out xD

By unlucky i mean how they just wet themselves in front of me and i couldn't see anything :/

Big deal, you're never seen somebody have a humiliating accident in public, why would you even wish for that to happen to someone?

It's like wishing you could see a car accident because it's cool watching cars flip.

}}

First I meant that, how close i was to see one and miss it. Second, i don't want it happen to everyone i see, but if we are in a water park, no one will know what happened, so it shouldn't be that humiliating, and Third, what would you do if you see a girl you like (doesn't matter if you know her or not) in that moment, close you eyes and pretend nothing happened?

And come on, how can you compare a car accident with a little "accident" -.-

{{ 

I can compare car crashes and wetting yourself because their both accidents that people may enough watching, but it's horrible for the people who're actually involved in the accident itself.

Also because I found the idea of cars flipping amusing.

}}

But, one thing just happen and 2 days later is forgotten, perhaps you laugh about that later, is save, but a car accident, if you survive maaaaybe, after psychological help you can talk about that normaly... some month after ._.

Well, sorry if my post bothers you, i just need to tell that someone...
