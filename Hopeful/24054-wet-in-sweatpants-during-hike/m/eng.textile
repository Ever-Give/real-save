So I have the house for myself for a couple days, and I decided I would work up a desperation and eventually pee myself. Since I also have the dog while my family is away, I went for a hike up the mountain with her, wearing winter clothes, which included black snowpants. I was, and am, wearing black sweatpants beneath that, and white and brown boxer shorts. I drank half a large bottle of coke before leaving just to make sure I would have to pee soon (I have a very, very strong bladder).

I didn't plan to pee during the hike, just to build up desperation for when I had returned, but when I was up there I decided why not, so I "squirted" and leaked a few times while up there. It felt good to be able to do it out "in public", even though it was in the middle of a forest. I was a bit nervous that if I peed too much, people would smell it on me if I met anyone, but I only met two people, and only in passing, and they had no idea what I had done, which gives me a good feeling now that I think about it in hindsight :) .

I spent some time up at a bonfire site before heading back down, and when I inspected myself my sweatpants were only slightly damp, but dry, and the boxers had a kind of oval patch on them running down my penis. I was sure my boxers and pants would be more wet, but I didn't really mind, I'm glad I did it and now I'm just waiting for myself to get really desperate so that I can start to actually leak uncontrollably :3 .
