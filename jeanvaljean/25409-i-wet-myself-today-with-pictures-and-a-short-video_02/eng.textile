Thank you, I was rather desperate so you got to see a very nice end result. I was impressed too lol

{{:

Wow! Looks like you really had to go!

You've got another fan of your boxers over here!

Thanks man!!

I'm beginning to sense those boxers will eventually steal my identity and roam the streets

{{:

This is amazing! Also, I love the boxers...

}}

Those boxers are seriously outshining their master.

However, I have just gotten my hands on some new boxers which are equally, if not even more crazy.

Think horizontal stripes, Paul Smith type. Haven't been soaked yet, though.
