So i'm new to this sight, and i'm going to start out by saying hi, i'm 24 and have had this fetish since i was at least 8, my stories range from 8 to even know.

Sso it was a Saturday morning in the month of may...we had a carnival arrive in town so it was the best thing we could go too. my friends and i (i'm a guy though i mostly hang out with girls, not gay though just get along better with em) we decided to spend the entire day there....seriously from noon till about 11 at night that's a long time....enough time for me to keep an eye out for the one thing guys that have my fetish do...seek out the desperado's lol. well any way my luck and patience were wearing thin i had no luck....then one found me whilst waiting for a ride on the zipper...she was about 18 my age, had blueish green eyes with dirty blond hair that went down to her shoulders...was mixed with Russian and Spanish.

She was wearing a white knee length skirt with a light bluish shirt that said i love my dad.. i noticed she was twitchy and had that bare grim on her face as if she was contempt on getting on this ride at what ever costs...it was a long line...then again it had been a longer wait, but i watched on as the twitching grew to more of a bounce...and her face had a desperate look on it...looking at the skirt maid me wonder what she was wearing under it and what i would give to see them...wish was granted when she shot her hand in between her legs allowing me a fraction of a second look at what seemed to be white panties...

I knew she noticed me watching as her eyes locked on mine i quickly averted my eye contact. though it was funny because well she was standing in front of me kinda hard not to stare ya think...any way i tapped her on her shoulders and said hi...i noticed you seem to be bouncing a lot...do you need to use the restroom...ill hold your spot...i like the fetish, but i'm also a gentleman. "no thanks i'm good thanks though", oh your welcome was my reply...the zipper is a ride that has these carts that you get into more so like a cage and well it flips you upside down while going up and down like a zipper there's 2 people to a ride and my friend was behind me, who by the way is oblivious to my fetish, further more oblivious to the person in front of me, any way i miss counted as i thought i was going to get to ride with my friend, turned out i was headed in with this very attractive girl...

When we got in and sat down i asked "whats your name" she replied Jane and yours, Jose, well nice to meet you Jane the ride was fun...but not as fun as what happened...ok so the rides starting and as its going up the way you sit your like right next to the person...well she ended up putting her hand on mine ^_^ i was happy...

I think she was more scared...any way the ride starts flipping us around and turning us upside down slowly...as this is happening i'm getting excited...that's when i look over at Jane who has the scared/ shocked face...i was wondering what that shocked face was for until i felt rain....kinda odd i thought it was a clear night...confused i looked over Jane had tears forming in her eyes the ride was still going...then it hit me like your head hits those random odd hanging objects...she peed...and i was getting peed on... 

My face was soaked, my shirt had wet spots my jeans were soaked....i kinda looked like i took an odd shower this is because the ride kept rolling as it rolled and flipped it caused the pee to role and fall in the cage like thing we were in...well lets just say when the ride stopped and she and i got out i looked at her...she was covered...her dirty blond hair looked darker her white skirt was a pale yellow color and most of it had been soaked...her shirt had wet spots on it..

I did not know what to say..in my mind i wanted to grab this girl and thank her for the experience ..but what would others think, right?, well she started crying...i walked right up to her and said its ok...pulled her wet hair from the front of her face and lifted her chin...she was speechless ..all i could pull out of her mouth was i'm sorry, well, me being Mr. nice i said its ok...it happens to the best of us..i started laughing and said it does not bug me, she smiled at this and said thanks for making me feel better, to repay you for this indecent thing i have done she said she asked if she could take me on a date O.O...of course i said yes...and then came the next 3 years of our lives..

More to post as time goes on

No were not together anymore...as i found out she had cheated but those 3 years are filled with many stories...and awesome ones at that. you think i was brave for coming out like that...i tend to be honest with implications mostly...if they catch on they catch on if they dont well they dont...lol but my next one will be posted after work tonight so if i get a bunch of you guys to start reading these i would love it...also i take scenarios and match my stories as close to them as i can...ive got a few friends that do this on the side and i found out about it later in our friendships so we experimented a lot with different things
