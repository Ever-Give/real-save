Why I Don't Drink Coffee...

I'm going to get really transparent for a bit. Whenever I drink coffee, it always irritated my bladder, and can cause me to have accidents.I don't even like how it tastes. I think it tastes really bad, and I can usually only tolerate it if it's really diluted with something else. For some reason I forgot that, and decided to drink a few cups this morning. A few hours later, I felt a strong and sudden pressure in my bladder, and before I could do anything, I felt my underwear getting wet. Luckily I managed to hold the rest of it in, and prevented further damage. 

I changed my underwear, and there was a golf ball sized wet spot on the front of my underwear. Luckily just enough to dampen my underwear, and not go through to my pants. I rinsed out the underwear, and hung them up to dry out in my bedroom. I thought that was the end of it, silly me, because maybe an hour and a half later the same thing happens again. This time the urge was so strong that I had to hold it as hard as I could, and get to the bathroom as fast as I could. Luckily I avoided totally wetting myself, and rinsed out those undies too. It seems to have stopped now, but as I write this there's 2 pairs of soggy tighty whiteys drying out on the other side of the room.
