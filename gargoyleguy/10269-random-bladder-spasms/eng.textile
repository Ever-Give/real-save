I was playing one of the old gta games for ps2 yesterday because the save data got corrupted somehow and I now have to play all 100% over again. Anyway, I'm just sitting there on my bed. My bladder isn't even half full. When suddenly I feel it squeeze in a gentle, non-painful way. An instant later about a half cup of pee gushes out of me, and soaks my underwear. I could feel my boxers dripping badly, and I was just shocked that I had just wet myself involuntarily. Luckily it didn't soak through my pants, and I just changed into a dry pair of boxers. I was wondering, has something like this happened to anyone else here before? It was just so weird.

I've sometimes just had a little bit escape because I didn't realise that it was more than just a minor urge until it actually started coming out. But I always recognise it as soon as it starts and automatically tighten up immediately, so probably no more than a teaspoon escapes before i cut it off. Seems weird to be able to do half a cup before knowing what was happening and stopping it!

It probably wasn't half a cup at all. It just happened so fast, that's what it seemed like to me. In reality it was probably like a fraction of what I said.

This has happened to me a couple times. I didn't have as much come out. Many times ill be at work not really having to go and all the sudden i get a spasm and a squirt. Not often, but it does happen.

Did you have a lot of caffeine beforehand? Tends to irritate the bladder...

No, I barely drink any caffeine at all. Maybe it was just one of those weird random things.

Have you been holding a lot lately?

No, in fact hadn't been wetting for almost 3 months. It was really weird.
