I remember this happening to me when I was a little kid, like 8 I think it was. I was really tired, I think I was staying up late for some reason, a late night movie maybe. Anyway, I eventually got a full bladder and went to the bathroom to take care of it. I was so out of it though I just stood there, and didn't unzip or anything, just let loose, and of course started soaking my pants. In a few seconds I snapped more awake and stopped the flow, but the damage was done. There was a huge dark spot down to my knees. I crept to my room, and changed my clothes before anyone could find out what happened. My mom probably knew later though when she did the laundry, she must have right? The clothes would have smelled like old pee.
