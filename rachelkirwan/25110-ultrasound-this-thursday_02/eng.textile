Not to tease and build the suspense.... but when I said I made it, I meant I survived the day, but I didn't 'make it' in the 'to the toilet on time' sense.

I.e. I had a rather public accident.

Writing up the experience now :)

When you say "rather public" something tells me that you made it through the ultrasound without weeing yourself. Did you have an accident somewhere else naughty girl?

Almost finished writing ;)
