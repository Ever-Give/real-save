Excellent writing as usual! Have you posted you bladder procedures? Are they too weird to write about?

Which ones? I mean some of them might be of interest here. Others... were weird...

Actually, I'm curious about any bladder procedure.

I've worked in medical-device development. One engineer I worked for liked to image her kidney to test whether our devices presented tissue density and Doppler blood flow in correct relationship. A second accidentally (I presume) spilled salad oil on her skirt and went about her work looking like she had peed herself. Yet another put a peeing mermaid doll in a test tank. She also likes a (sadly terrible) popular-music group called "The Catheters." Later on my net surfing produced a clip of her sitting nude an a stack of drawers while peeing and mugging the camera. I've grown rather fond of medical procedures and the characters . . . I mean professionals involved.

Uro dynamics is one I should write about, though I was really unhappy about this test the three times I've done it, mostly because they insert a catheter in you and I AM NOT A FAN

I have just inserted a catheter to drain my bladder constantly. I use a small, 200ml capacity leg bag. It fills so often when I drink much. My plan is to leave it in my bladder for 3 days. At night I use a 2 liter bag for more comfort. I love to clamp it for daytime, and let my bladder fill like normal. Before removal, I also clamp the catheter for bladder training. Its very nice to have huge pee after it has been removed. Ask me if you have any questions.

Is leaving a catheter in for 3 days safe?
