Like everyone else, I'm so jealous you've got someone who has no qualms about doing this so regularly for you! Nice one ;-)

The best thing is that she does it for herself...often not even telling me, or when I'm not home.

DAMN!!!! You are one serious lucky guy!! I can't stress enough on how much I'd love to have a girl do this for me that I'm actually dating! A fantasy that I'd love to have happen an actually reality that can turn into having some fun with all this! Seriously, congrats to you on having her and do keep her close :)

Thanks...and like I just said, the best thing is if she does it for herself too...it really turns her on!

I have had girlfriends do it for me...but where it wasn't a thing that turned them on as such, and that somehow left me feeling guilty or awkward about the whole thing.

This time it amazes me how natural it can be...maybe that is the true meaning of a soul mate...that you can share the weird parts of yourself with someone, and feel totally good about it

Imagine to go shopping with your girlfriend, and it being the most natural thing to look for clothes that would look great when she pees in them

Just to let you know ...we're still having fun...and she's still the one

The times when you catch your girlfriend "red handed" ...or maybe it is "wet handed"

Good for her that she has such an understanding perv for a boyfriend...hehe

The carefree attitude of a naughty girl, on a warm summers day on the patio ...
