Just to celebrate that this thread is 5 years old!! ...and to celebrate that my sweet girlfriend is still the one

The pictures are from a day we went plane-spotting, and at some point another car pulled up alongside us.

My girlfriend was suddenly in a hurry to get back into the car

I love those silly secret games!

Happy anniversary! I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love for you to post more than annually.

Thanks

My enthusiasm for posting is greatly reduced by the fact that everything you post here, gets spread all over the net.

Even if you try to reduce any recognizable stuff in the pictures to an absolute minimum ...you still get that lingering paranoia, and it sorta spoils the fun.

Only just stumbled on this thread after it surfaced again. That is a phenomenal woman you have to share your life with. The shorts/pantyhose combo is an absolute winner.

Are you still together?
