So yesterday morning I had a real honest to goodness wetting accidenr. Almost all my accidents to date had been forced or outright fake.

I work and am awake allot these days, some days I exist on 3 hours of sleep or less, so when I hit home I hit bed. This isn't my first time I neglected my prebed bathroom duties.

I hadn't noticed a need for a pee or I would've gone, didn't really wanna mess my bed and have to clean it. Normally if I have to pee while asleep my bladder will scream bloody murder. This time I must have been so exhausted my need to pee got shoved into my imagination instead of my need to do list.

I don't remember the dream in its entirety but I end up at a ceramic looking toilet with the need to go, so I do. Parr of me is now realizing my crotch is growing wet and warm despite the fact that I'm peeing in the toilet.

That part of me wakes me, the entire crotch of my blue briefs dark and wet, still warm, a small crotch sized puddle on my bed. After the initial shock of having an actual accident I have to admit I got off to it... literally.
