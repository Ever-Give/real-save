So a little experince. Been a while since I posted. When I want I wet, at the store, anywhere, just a spritz, enough to warm the crotch and make a barely noticble wet patch. I've wet all the way but never fully in public, at work once too. But when I wet I hsve to force it, never an accident.

However I try to go to sleep with a full bladder, even turn on hour long water sounds, and nothinv, i wake painfully full and have to use the b room but no accidents.....
