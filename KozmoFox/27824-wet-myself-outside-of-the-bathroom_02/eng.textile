Not sure what else to say, I guess, but if you end up with any more stories like this, myself and probably the rest of the people who have read this implore you to write more.

True, true!

Would rather be dead than leave the house without at LEAST some eyeliner.

Yes, I do love to be descriptive. I tend to ramble tons so I think it might come from that. I don't know when to stop xD

This is the closest call I've ever had by far.

There's not usually a smell for me, not a strong one. I always go before holds and drink tons to make sure its very diluted.
