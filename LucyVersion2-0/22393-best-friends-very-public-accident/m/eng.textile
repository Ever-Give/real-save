My best friend of 18 years suffers real-life bladder problems. Unfortunately, he doesn't enjoy them, but he's been kind enough to share some stories of his accidents, one of which I'll recount here...

He had a doctor's appointment a few years ago, and since he doesn't drive, he had to take the bus. By the time he got to the medical complex, he was bursting. He didn't know where the bathroom was, and didn't want to ask, so he just got on the elevator, doing everything he could to hold it, hoping not to wet himself in front of all the other passengers. But, alas, he just lost it, and unfortunately for him, he wore khakis that day, so it was very obvious he'd had an accident. He didn't miss his appointment though. He checked in, and when the receptionist told him to have a seat, he replied that he couldn't, and gestured to his wet pants. She was nice, and put him in a room right away. When he saw the doctor, he blamed his meds for making him wet himself, but the doctor told him that wasn't the case. I thought it was a cute story, because my friend can laugh at it now.
