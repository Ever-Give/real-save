Note: English is not my native languaje, so I apologize for my mistakes.

This happened to me recently, That morning, more or less 9 a.m. I was in a place called La Plazuela del Carolino, it´s a touristic place in the downtown of the city, in that place there are toilets, but you have to insert a coin of $5 pesos (1/3 of dollar aproximatelly) in a control panel, that thing has got 3 push buttons, I supouse these kind of machine is common in another countries, but here is something relativelly new. The control panel has got a button to open the male toilet, one for the female and one for toilet papper.

That day I has got to use the rest room and there are no other public ones nearby, I entered to the Plazuela and when I was aproaching to the restrooms I watched a girl obviously desperated, dancing from foot to foot in front of the control panel, she was reading the instructions (Note: I think the instructive is on english); I slow myself, to be honest she was really cute, 1.50 mts tall, light brown hair, she was an athletic girl, she was wearing white jeans, tennis and a top (I think it was pink), and her desperation makes her more atractive for me, as you can imagine.

When I told her, with my best kind voice “Excuse me, is there a problem?” She turned to me (keep dancing the pee pee dance still) “Yes please! May I watch how you do use this thing?”

Then I insested the $5 coin and push the male button, the “beep” sound anounced the male door was open, and I push it to avoid it gets closed but I didn´t enter, after that I told her “See? Just insert the coin and push the womans rest room button”

She Thanks me and hurried insert the coin she has got in her hand, then push the button, but... she makes a mistake, she push the toilet paper one, and the machine started to give paper, she stuned “What the...?!” She turned to me in a mixture of frustrarion and desperation in her face, “What happened?”.

“Nothing, (I told her) you just push the wrong button, that one is for the womens toilet, this is for the paper” She was in panic in that moment, “Excuse me!!! Do you have another $5 coin, I am about to pee right here!” I searched in my pockets for another coin, and finally find one, she takes it from my hand quickly( and almost rudeway) saying “Thanks”, she inserted the coin and push the right button this time, but she was wetting herself in that moment, I watched the wet patch in her jeans, it was clearly visible in her but when she entered to the ladies room.

I enter to the toilet and go out quiclky, and wait for her out, you know, “I had to recover my $5” she takes her time to get out, blushed face, she gives me back my money, I offered my help if she wanted, I told her “I work near here...”, but she told me she had called a friend and she was going to wait inside there.

That´s all, luckly for her there not use to be so much people in the Plazuela in the morning
