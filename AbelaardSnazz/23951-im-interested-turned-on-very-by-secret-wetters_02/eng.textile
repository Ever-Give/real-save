Good luck with the horsey girls and with riding, I have not myself ridden a horse for many years now......Lol I,ve probably eaten more horse steaks than taken rides on horses....Yep parts of Europe do like their horse steak.......I think I would have a job looking some of my g/fs in the eye and admitting that I had eaten horse steak, but when I feel that way I just remember the agonising times that a horse has stepped on me, kicked me or tried to throw me.....

Then it is a bit easier to admit that I have dined on their pals! But if you do feel that you are on a winning streak with a girl, just make it sound innocent and that the ex g/f was quite open and forward about her wetting (takes all kinds or people to make a world) this usually allows one to make statements about this 'fetish' and have it accepted. You then have the option if the girl is 'put off' to say something like "Thats one of the reasons why we had to part" or on the other hand if she is not put off, that leaves it open for you to follow up with tales of how exciting it sometimes made things when you got used to it.

Thank you Gobphus I do know that at times I made her very happy and even when we agreed to part she told me I was her best experience....jobs and work came between me and this girl...as was often the case, I did not even live near enough to commute weekends for our relationship to flourish any more than it did.
