Birthday Wetting!

So, today is my birthday. I turned 21. Now, I haven't had any good Omo in at least a month, and I felt I was getting long overdue.

When I haven't wet in a long time, it starts becoming hard again, as if my pants are a shield that prevents me from letting go. For my birthday, I wanted to get past that. Just a few minutes ago, I said to myself "what the hell, it's your birthday". I'm wearing jean-shorts and a light cyan T-shirt. I wanted it to be spontaneous, unlike most of my times, which are carefully planned out to be undetectable and not to stain. I just layed on my back in bed, pulled my light blue blanket over me, and let go. My legs were arched, not completely flat. I just sat in bed, let go, and allowed whatever was in my bladder (a considerable amount) to exit my body and enter my sheets and unprotected mattress. It felt awesome.

Afterwards, I enjoyed the wet bed, and did that little stretchy-thing I sometimes do with my feet and legs after I've had either a good yank or some good Omo. I'm laying belly-first in my warm puddle now. It feels wonderful. My butt is cold from my desk fan blowing on it. Mom is awake, she'd catch me if she walked in this room right now. As I type the period for this sentence, I will have just pushed out more into my unprotected bed. I hope it doesn't stain, but hey, happy birthday to me!
