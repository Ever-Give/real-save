Today, I was just about to be on my way home but i had to potty first... I wasn't wearing a diaper and my bladder couldn't take much pressure at all which it never can take much. So i rushed to the closest bathroom. Since I was in a hurry, I leveled my little butt over the tiolet bowl instead of actually sitting on it. When the stream started to come, It ran all over my legs with only 1/3 actually going in the tiolet. The other 2/3 was on my legs and dripping all over the floor and the seat... It felt really nice and warm.. i started blushing and realized there was no tiolet paper to clean myself off. This happened over 4 or so hours ago and i still haven't changed out yet. Just put on a little baby powder so i don't have a rash. It was too nice even though it was a little embarrassing and my face was as red as a tomato after it happened.
